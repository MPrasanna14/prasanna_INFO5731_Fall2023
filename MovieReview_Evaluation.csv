1,"unfortunately , he's barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen't appear at all !",positive
2,also disappointing is natascha mcelhone's character sylvia .,positive
3,"she plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her .",positive
4,"the supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it's creepy .",positive
5,"the philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film .",positive
6,"peter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun .",positive
7,the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card .,positive
8,"although it is slightly slow to begin with , about half an hour into film the pace really picks up , and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll .",positive
9,"sadly , though , the film is practically over when the film is in full steam .",positive
10,"also , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous , which was disappointing .",positive
11,"the screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim .",positive
12,"while christoff's plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly , they never go over the line , which would have been easy for niccol to do .",positive
13,"also , there's some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show .",positive
14,"overall , the truman show is excellent entertainment .",positive
15,"certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces , it should be viewed by everyone .",positive
16,"it offers something to every member of the audience , and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed .",positive

19,""" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes",positive
20,"no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan's harrowing , humorous , horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe's novel about young lad francie brady's ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland .",positive
21,"on one hand , it was difficult for me to become invested in francie's story because he is such an unsavory character , unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) .",positive
22,"on another hand , i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie's darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick , needy child , having been raised by a drunken father ( stephen rea ) and a suicidal mother ( aisling o'sullivan ) .",positive
23,"on yet another hand , i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his , for lack of a better word , "" bad "" deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them .",positive
24,"however , the butcher boy's power is undeniable , and the film as a whole is unforgettable--perhaps because it is so disturbing .",positive
25,"what makes it so unsettling is the francie's overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude about everything , expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie ( rea again ) .",positive
26,"think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs , and you'll sort of understand .",positive
27,"anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens ; love francie or hate him , you cannot take your eyes off of owens .",positive
28,"the butcher boy truly is a twisted , unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable .",positive
29,"in the lobby after the screening , i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was ; i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust , "" that movie was so unfunny ! """,positive
30,""" i didn't know what to expect .",positive
31,"it's like something you chase for so long , but then you don't know how to react when you get it .",positive

35,just how inseparable is the team of sgt .,positive
36,martin riggs ( mel gibson ) and sgt .,positive
37,roger murtaugh ( danny glover ) ?,positive
38,"let's just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road , flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction , his partner actually does it !",positive
39,"the familiar lethal weapon family is back , including rene russo , who is now the expectant mother of riggs' child and joe pesci as the soprana-like , foul-mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye .",positive
40,"new to the team is chris rock , also a fast-talking , up and coming detective .",positive
41,"trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go , and in this film , that is no exception .",positive
42,"even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride , they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship .",positive
43,"we here some ominous music , which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen .",positive
44,"gunfire ensues , and when it's all over , the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord .",positive
45,"although they don't know what they're looking for , their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action .",positive
46,and there's plenty of action here for two movies .,positive
47,"led by fighting sensation jet li , whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive , he does what he can to make sure that no one finds out what they are up to .",positive
48,"li is ruthless in his approach , will kill anyone just to make a point , and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives .",positive
49,"there are terrific car chases , explosions and gunshot galore .",positive
50,"it's a summer action recipe followed to the letter , and the result is nothing less than pure , unadulterated summer fun .",positive
51,but even too many explosions can get boring .,positive
52,"to counter that , we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li .",positive
53,"luckily , he'd rather fight hand-to-hand instead of firing off guns .",positive
54,"meanwhile , when the detectives aren't reloading their guns or running from fireballs , they're engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets .",positive
55,everybody gets in on the shtick .,positive
56,"russo screams during her delivery , the crime lord has a few funny bits when he's being interrogated while being given laughing gas , and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones .",positive
57,gibson and glover are always in sync and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano .,positive
58,score one for the old guard .,positive
59,"since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style .",positive
60,"now , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow .",positive
61,"this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993's schindler's list shows .",positive
62,"most of today's mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience .",positive
63,"that's why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema .",positive
64,"the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950's company town of coalwood , west virginia .",positive
65,it's a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine .,positive
66,"the mine , which is run by homer's father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however .",positive
67,"after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , "" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . """,positive
68,"drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets .",positive
69,"with the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things .",positive
70,"october sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston .",positive
71,johnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he's doing here .,positive
72,he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust .,positive
73,"he does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film's charm .",positive
74,"his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer's mother and father .",positive
75,"the cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles .",positive
76,"laura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need .",positive
77,her role is instantly likeable .,positive
78,"chris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer's father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie .",positive
79,"he's definitely a driving force in homer's life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable .",positive
80,"the script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys' endeavors in a lighthearted manner .",positive
81,there are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist .,positive
82,"it highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps .",positive
83,october sky should be a success with audiences .,positive
84,"although it doesn't have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she's all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards .",positive
85,"it's a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see .",positive
86,a big surprise to me .,positive
87,"the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope .",positive
88,they replaced him just fine .,positive
89,"not with john goodman , he didn't do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can really sing .",positive
90,"the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who's ten .",positive
91,"this was another of my fears for the film , but he's a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed ) .",positive
92,"things that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all .",positive
93,"i'm quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing .",positive
94,"there's a few early crashes , and then one huge pile-up , but after that it all stops .",positive
95,it's just the music .,positive
96,"one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway's song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him , but there's no problems with this .",positive
97,"the music is all as good as ever , tons of great musicians showing up -- with the exception of johnny lang , who can't sing , all the musicians do a great job .",positive
98,the only real problems i had was the special effects .,positive
99,these were superfluous and a waste of money .,positive
100,"since the film isn't doing very well , they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel , which i want to see .",positive

106,"after having heard so many critics describe "" return to me "" as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ?",positive
107,"what made "" return to me "" old-fashioned and old-hollywood ?",positive
108,"was it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ?",positive
109,"was it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ?",positive
110,the charisma of the two leads ?,positive
111,"even now i can't say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven't see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances .",positive
112,i don't think any of the romances i've seen have been classified as such .,positive
113,"which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- "" return to me "" was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider .",positive
114,"it was traditional , magical .",positive
115,"we knew it couldn't be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in .",positive
116,"it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn't help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings .",positive
117,the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt's direction .,positive
118,"from the very first bird's eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the "" return to me "" ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we're in for something sweet .",positive
119,"the scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy .",positive
120,real people don't act that way ; real people aren't that nice .,positive
121,"we know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks' existence .",positive
122,"the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt's rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal .",positive
123,everything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film .,positive
124,>from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob's wardrobes .,positive
125,"from the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints .",positive
126,from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part .,positive
127,""" return to me "" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist .",positive
128,"we care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we're concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father .",positive
129,"whatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors .",positive
130,"disappointingly , david alan grier's charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written .",positive
131,duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder .,positive
132,"instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of "" the x-files . """,positive
133,"duchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen .",positive
134,"minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer .",positive
135,"though an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses .",positive
136,"while "" return to me "" functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop .",positive
137,the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife's heart .,positive
138,"we already know that there's going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point .",positive
139,"as a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--yes , i know she's supposed to have his ex-wife's heart and everything--it seems too effortless .",positive
140,"the main subject is a love story , and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters ( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) .",positive
141,"however , in the spirit of "" return to me , "" it won't do to be too picky about how "" old "" hollywood tells its stories .",positive
142,i loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt .,positive
143,it shows .,positive
144,"the bottom line : "" return to me "" is nothing remarkable , and yet its sweetness , sincerity , and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn't imagined .",positive
145,"wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal .",positive
146,the setting of the film is a town named blue bay .,positive
147,"it consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town's different benefactors .",positive
148,"the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town's ritzy , expensive high school .",positive
149,it is here that we meet all of the core characters .,positive
150,"there's guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan .",positive
151,"we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly .",positive
152,throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape .,positive
153,"shortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well .",positive
154,"this pushes kelly's sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing until sam is convicted .",positive
155,"during the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her .",positive
156,"however , it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls , it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor .",positive
157,"after sam is cleared , kelly's mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her .",positive
158,"it is then revealed that sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together .",positive
159,it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda .,positive
160,matt dillon stars as sam lombardo .,positive
161,"sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into , and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage .",positive
162,"he isn't the obvious best of actors , but dillon does give a convincing performance .",positive
163,"however , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place .",positive
164,"neve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller .",positive
165,suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film .,positive
166,"campbell is very successful with this character , adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch .",positive
167,playing kelly van ryan is denise richards .,positive
168,"kelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra .",positive
169,one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother .,positive
170,"denise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film .",positive
171,"in the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character , but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well .",positive
172,kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette .,positive
173,"this character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film .",positive
174,"however , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story .",positive
175,"still , the film doesn't seem to gain much from bacon's performance , only his name .",positive
176,"in the supporting cast , theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan , daphne rubin-vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez , and bill murray shines as sam's lawyer , ken bowden .",positive
177,hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film .,positive
178,"although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller , the eroticism , which is portrayed with good taste , is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters .",positive
179,this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it's share of twists .,positive

181,"the previous two "" alien "" films have each had their own unique styles to them .",positive

184,and i liked each film separately for which it was .,positive
185,now alien 3 is out .,positive

190,"the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg .",positive

192,this vessel crash lands on fury 109 .,positive
193,"everyone in the vessel is killed , except ripley .",positive
194,the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash .,positive
195,fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison .,positive
196,"when closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet .",positive
197,all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years .,positive
198,ripley's arrival sparks a problem with the inmates .,positive
199,"as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner's sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet .",positive
200,being an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons .,positive
201,so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own .,positive
202,"i will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here .",positive
203,the alien is loose and no one believes ripley's outstanding story .,positive
204,she finds comfort in the arms of the colony's doctor .,positive
205,"yes , after 57 years ripley has sex .",positive
206,"it is not gratuitous , in fact , we don't even see them kiss , but it is just as well .",positive
207,a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film .,positive
208,there is a lot more gore in alien 3 .,positive
209,in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two .,positive
210,it also sports a new alien with 4 legs !,positive
211,"i won't say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 .",positive
212,sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character .,positive
213,her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination .,positive
214,the rest of the cast is also quite good .,positive
215,"notably , charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109 .",positive
216,alien 3 has a very distinct look .,positive
217,"this is due largely to its director , david fincher .",positive
218,"mr . fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here .",positive
219,"his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no "" alien "" film has before .",positive
220,"for mr . fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him .",positive
221,the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry .,positive
222,"elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the "" alien "" series been set in .",positive
223,this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner's aliens ) .,positive
224,this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring .,positive
225,this is a great score .,positive
226,the ending to alien 3 is quite good .,positive
227,"there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely .",positive
228,i will not ruin the ending for you .,positive
229,go see the film .,positive
230,i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season .,positive
231,alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien .,positive

238,welcome to sarajevo,positive
239,"in light of america's recent intervention in kosovo , welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years .",positive
240,"set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events , this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war .",positive
241,the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding .,positive
242,"as they make their way down the street , a sniper shoots the mother of the bride .",positive
243,yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war .,positive
244,"in this scene , we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson ) , an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church .",positive

246,his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane ) .,positive
247,michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world's lack of interest .,positive
248,henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread .,positive

255,"however , his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina ( marisa tomei ) and her children's aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans .",positive
256,"unfortunately , only babies are wanted for adoption , so henderson pledges to take emira to england .",positive
257,"the group of children , nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy .",positive
258,can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ?,positive
259,the movie was beautifully and sensitively made .,positive
260,director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred .,positive
261,"they show the destroyed lives , families that have been split up , and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with .",positive
262,"this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended .",positive
263,the group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities .,positive
264,one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth .,positive
265,"like the rest of those deeply effected by the war , this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live .",positive
266,winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room .,positive
267,the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics .,positive
268,winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities .,positive
269,this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies . com,positive
270,selection mad city .,positive
271,"we watch them struggle to cover the horror , while trying to remain professionally detached .",positive
272,"however , they are human and question the reason behind it all , why no one cares , and how they can get out .",positive
273,stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson .,positive
274,he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events .,positive
275,dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy .,positive
276,"henderson realizes that he cannot save the world , but he can help a few .",positive
277,it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary-sandra bullock disaster two if by sea .,positive
278,"woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest , most versatile actors of his generation .",positive
279,harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character's caring nature and vulnerability shine through .,positive
280,"harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men ( cheers , white men can't jump ) as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one .",positive
281,"this ability will serve him well and give him a long , successful career .",positive
282,america's involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place .,positive
283,"for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict , the entire movie , most importantly the opening scenes , provide a history lesson .",positive
284,war is a foreign concept to most of us in america .,positive
285,battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to .,positive
286,televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war .,positive
287,"this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world , something we don't do enough of in 90's america .",positive
288,many people dislike french films for their lack of closure .,positive
289,"while possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view .",positive
290,"there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) .",positive
291,stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker .,positive
292,he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing .,positive
293,"even the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches .",positive
294,"in the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man .",positive
295,camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes .,positive
296,maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife .,positive
297,"like stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges .",positive
298,"when stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals .",positive
299,"however , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him .",positive
300,"stephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present .",positive
301,"as the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another .",positive
302,"these two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently .",positive
303,"stephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship .",positive
304,"however , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation .",positive
305,"the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher .",positive
306,"however , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing .",positive
307,"consequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays .",positive
308,"in contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier .",positive
309,"however , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing .",positive
310,"during the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions .",positive
311,stephane attempts to remain unchanged .,positive
312,"however , we do see subtle hints of his transformation .",positive
313,one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash .,positive
314,"the development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible .",positive
315,"american movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development .",positive
316,"in its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane .",positive
317,"the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters .",positive
318,"i am not sure why berardinelli says , "" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . """,positive
319,"this movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are .",positive
320,"i find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling .",positive
321,"this portion of the film is where the "" sense of closure "" could have been successfully accomplished .",positive
322,"unfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters .",positive
323,"while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film .",positive
324,the synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen .,positive
325,the directing in this movie is wonderful .,positive
326,"the actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth .",positive
327,emmanuelle beart's personality is beautiful .,positive
328,"and needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful .",positive
329,"besides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral .",positive
330,i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of .,positive
331,"the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ?",positive
332,"i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing .",positive
333,"in summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship .",positive
334,"in the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people .",positive
335,"in itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie .",positive
336,"where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people .",positive
337,i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture .,positive
338,"however , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film .",positive
339,i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it .,positive
340,"the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled `where the money is . '",positive
341,"the elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught .",positive
342,he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune .,positive
343,"always the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail .",positive
344,this involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis .,positive
345,"when he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke .",positive
346,"now a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home .",positive
347,carol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him .,positive
348,she's a very bright person with a good heart .,positive
349,"yet , her life is a miserable waste of time .",positive
350,the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars .,positive
351,her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics .,positive
352,"worse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) .",positive
353,they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom .,positive
354,"to her , this made sense long ago .",positive
355,"but now , it's a different story .",positive
356,"wayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put .",positive
357,wayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman .,positive
358,"carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life .",positive
359,"however , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change .",positive
360,the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke .,positive
361,"carol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all .",positive
362,"maybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away .",positive
363,the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . ',positive
364,and what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ?,positive
365,perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses .,positive
366,"if that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below .",positive
367,"when he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining .",positive
368,carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness .,positive
369,she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy .,positive
370,"this , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation .",positive
371,henry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car .,positive
372,henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash .,positive
373,"meanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life .",positive
374,"wayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless .",positive
375,"however , his lack of commitment threatens their success .",positive
376,"the heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong .",positive
377,`where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist .,positive
378,"newman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff .",positive
379,"he possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive .",positive
380,fiorentino is also a fun presence .,positive
381,you root for her despite her sense of amorality .,positive
382,"sure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic .",positive
383,"with two charismatic characters such as these , it's hard to ignore that `where the money is' is where the fun is .",positive
384,"robert benton has assembled a stellar , mature cast for his latest feature , twilight , a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood .",positive
385,paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross .,positive
386,"harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon ) , a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight .",positive
387,"when jack sends him on a routine delivery job , however , the old instincts kick in .",positive
388,"soon , harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line , and he no longer knows who to trust .",positive
389,"there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight , in addition to newman , hackman and sarandon .",positive
390,"james garner plays raymond hope , a former cop and one of harry's best friends .",positive
391,"stockard channing plays verna , harry's former partner , and possibly a former love interest .",positive
392,"reese witherspoon is mel , the distrustful daughter of the ames' , and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend .",positive
393,"giancarlo esposito appears as harry's bumbling detective protigi , and john spencer is a suspicious police captain .",positive
394,"with a cast like that , it's almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze .",positive
395,"luckily , there's more to the film than some sort of actor's recognition ceremony .",positive
396,twilight has a solid film noir-ish plot .,positive
397,"it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics , but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days .",positive
398,"the major cast members all deliver strong performances , as can be expected of their caliber .",positive
399,"however , none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable .",positive
400,"the supporting cast is enjoyable , if a little underdrawn .",positive
401,"stockard channing's character , in particular , is a cipher .",positive
402,there's more to her character than the film takes the time to describe .,positive
403,"it's a minor , but irritating , flaw .",positive
404,"with a solid cast , and a good plot , there's a lot to recommend about twilight .",positive
405,it's biggest flaw is actually its short running time .,positive
406,"at a slim 94 minutes , there's a lot of stuff that's packed into an awfully small package .",positive
407,"still , the chance to see newman , sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two .",positive
408,"warning : anyone offended by blatant , leering machismo had better avoid this film .",positive
409,"or lots of blood & guts , men against men and mano-et-mano stuff .",positive
410,"in other words , it's a walter hill film !",positive
411,with a john milius script !,positive
412,i always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between arm-wrestling matches .,positive
413,"these films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with , probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb .",positive
414,"and we got tough guys galore , here ; drug-running banditos by the dozens , all dirty and sweaty and pretty ill-tempered , overall ; a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to cover-up ( supposedly ) any connection between the government and the drug runners ; and lots of shit-kicking texas dirt farmers who'd as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you .",positive
415,"in particular , we got nick nolte as one hard-ass texas ranger , powers boothe as the drug kingpin , michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army , and rip torn as the local sheriff .",positive
416,torn is the sympathetic figure of the group ; he smiles before shooting anyone .,positive
417,as to women . . .,positive
418,"well , i've never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film , and at this rate , i doubt i ever will .",positive
419,"women exist here to look good , comfort the man , and get argued over .",positive
420,gosh !,positive
421,just like the old days . . .,positive
422,"frankly , this is a pretty good movie , if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff .",positive
423,"the cinematography is excellent , the cast of characters is broad and has texture , the script is quite good , and the film lets you keep up with what's happening yourself , without spelling it out to you .",positive
424,i appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up .,positive
425,"finally , there's lots of sam peckinpah slow-motion shoot-ups .",positive
426,"accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over .",positive
427,one could almost say the same about his much-prized film .,positive
428,"rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth .",positive
429,"in short , the antithesis of all things hollywood .",positive
430,yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind .,positive
431,"ralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film .",positive
432,"but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him .",positive
433,his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld .,positive
434,"the same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many .",positive
435,juliette binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart .,positive
436,"at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger .",positive
437,"even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical .",positive
438,"with so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film's 160 minutes can be taxing .",positive
439,yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn't help but feel that greatness was in the air .,positive
440,hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war .,positive
441,there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years .,positive
442,but ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed .,positive
443,"in the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore .",positive
444,bore is perhaps too strong a word .,positive
445,"but after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full .",positive
446,"a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates , a film which was based on the best-seller by george v . , higgins .",positive
447,"it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie "" fingers "" coyle ( mitchum ) .",positive
448,he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment .,positive
449,"his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire , something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn't think he could survive prison at his age .",positive
450,he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare .,positive
451,"he could have cut a deal and gotten off , if he turned his boss over to the d . a . , but he figured he would never live if he did that .",positive
452,he is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) .,positive
453,the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager's house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it .,positive
454,"on one of the heists , they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm .",positive
455,"coyle's best friend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender .",positive
456,"he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents , as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record , as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs .",positive
457,"with the sentencing date closing in on him , the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time .",positive
458,he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain .,positive
459,"thinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire , he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down , knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence .",positive
460,"but foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer , that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence , they want him to be a full-time informer .",positive
461,warning : spoiler follows in next paragraph .,positive
462,the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend .,positive
463,the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up .,positive
464,"coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , "" to be young like that and have his future , he's the greatest hockey player in the world . """,positive
465,"dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style , having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston .",positive
466,"this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets , of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in , and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next .",positive
467,"the city streets are ugly , the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , whether it is betrayal or murder .",positive
468,"there is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat .",positive
469,"mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot .",positive
470,it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them .,positive
471,"mitchum is a loser ; and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor .",positive
472,"but in the end , he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy , as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle .",positive
473,""" footloose "" has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics .",positive
474,and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it .,positive
475,"the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) .",positive
476,he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do .,positive
477,"as mentioned at the beginning of this review , "" footloose "" is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama .",positive
478,"there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate .",positive
479,so why did i enjoy it so much ?,positive
480,"for one thing , the cast is great .",positive
481,kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role .,positive
482,"we're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the "" rebel without a clue "" sort .",positive
483,"yes , he does rebel , but he's also polite when he needs to be .",positive
484,and he never broods .,positive
485,the rest of the cast is equally impressive .,positive
486,"john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian .",positive
487,but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter .,positive
488,"by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character .",positive
489,another nice touch is the music .,positive
490,"we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with "" sexual innuendos "" , but that's not true at all .",positive
491,"the title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun .",positive
492,"during the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing .",positive
493,"of course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic .",positive
494,"anyway , "" footloose "" is a charming little surprise .",positive
495,don't let the premise prevent you from watching it .,positive
496,"it sucked me in , and it'll do the same to you .",positive
497,"as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film .",positive
498,"with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a "" great "" piece of work and viceversa .",positive
499,attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs .,positive
500,i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology .,positive
501,"as the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master .",positive
502,as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality .,positive
503,"crouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category .",positive
504,"crouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology .",positive
505,"it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable .",positive
506,"all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement .",positive
507,"the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two .",positive
508,"it is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend .",positive
509,the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented .,positive
510,the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively .,positive
511,"the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake .",positive
512,there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry .,positive
513,"as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy .",positive
514,"do not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed .",positive

528,"but rather than applaud the production , early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown "" afterschool special . """,positive
529,"even worse , in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people , the studio got a case of the heebie-jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re-shoot scenes and cut footage to "" tone things down .

542,"while noting the racial and social differences between the kids , the screenplay dances around most of the clich ? s ( there are still several mtv moments , though ) .",positive

555,"this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns "" erstwhile fogy "" giles into a three-dimensional human being .",positive
556,"despite his tunnel vision , it's impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love .",positive

567,"but , while giles' affection runs deep , ronnie's feelings are less constant .",positive
568,"love and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that .",positive
569,"in fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect .",positive
570,"it suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it .",positive
571,"in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target .",positive
572,"in the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited .",positive
573,"from start to finish , this is clearly hurt's movie ? he's in almost every frame .",positive
574,"it's a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions .",positive
575,"jason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie .",positive
576,"he is charismatic , and it's not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie .",positive
577,"meanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin .",positive
578,"love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a "" fish out of water "" tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) .",positive

608,that's the question they must face : comfort or real experiences ?,positive
609,the film takes some interesting chances .,positive
610,non-traditional relationships are presented as matter-of-fact .,positive

619,"frances mcdormand does a good job of her limited role of sara , grady's married lover but we never understand much of who she is .",positive
620,the chemistry between the two of them is non-existent which makes some of the ending unconvincing .,positive
621,"katie holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor , but her character goes nowhere .",positive
622,we never even see grady's exiting wife .,positive
623,this is very much a guy's film .,positive
624,the varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others .,positive
625,"grady's alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film , not him and sara .",positive
626,"as the boomers age , expect to see more mid-life crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic .",positive

638,"for one thing , death-as-pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter , played by claire forlani .",positive
639,"obviously this enrages hopkins , because really , what can death offer ?",positive
640,"besides eternal damnation , of course .",positive
641,there is also a sub-plot about forlani's ex-boyfriend ( she dumps him for pitt ) trying to take over hopkins company .,positive
642,""" meet joe black "" runs just under three hours .",positive
643,i've always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics .,positive
644,""" meet joe black "" is neither historical nor is it an epic , though i get the feeling martin brest ( the director ) desperately wants it to be .",positive
645,every single scene in the movie goes on about 3-4 minutes too long .,positive
646,and the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should .,positive
647,"a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent , instead of just good , which is what it is .",positive
648,"pitt , an actor i normally loathe , is actually quite engaging as death .",positive
649,"i believed his performance , and i could see why forlani's character would fall in love with him .",positive
650,"i have to agree with roger ebert , though , who found it hard to believe that an entity that's been around for all time wouldn't know what peanut butter was .",positive
651,"that has nothing to do with pitt's performance , of course , but it is a little distracting .",positive
652,hopkins gives his usual excellent performance .,positive
653,"he's able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left , without making him an obnoxious whiner .",positive
654,"and in her first major studio role , claire forlani is surprisingly good .",positive
655,she has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her .,positive
656,"so , "" meet joe black "" is a good movie hampered by it's ridiculous running time .",positive

659,"gregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist .",positive
660,"if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven .",positive
661,"in fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out .",positive
662,( remember bob ? ),positive
663,"the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it's consistently interesting , it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope .",positive
664,"a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice .",positive
665,"now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , "" what goes around really goes around . """,positive
666,"shortly thereafter , he begins to sing "" time is on my side "" as he's taken on his last walk .",positive
667,"minutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead .",positive
668,"but for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn't a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel .",positive
669,"and , with reese's death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will .",positive
670,"only hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they're up against .",positive
671,"the rest of the cops , including hobbes' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don't have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger .",positive
672,"as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one .",positive
673,no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown .,positive
674,the most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ; it's geno's steaks .,positive
675,shadows and night scenes abound .,positive
676,the days are cloudy and unpromising .,positive
677,this is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men .,positive
678,"fallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized .",positive
679,"somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise .",positive
680,"but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check .",positive
681,"nevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks .",positive
682,the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual .,positive
683,"of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance .",positive
684,"john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick .",positive
685,"sadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel .",positive
686,"everyone else , including denzel washington , is boring .",positive
687,washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film .,positive
688,"it's not that he's bad per se , but he's not very interesting .",positive
689,"there's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes .",positive
690,"as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was .",positive
691,washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency .,positive
692,"however , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler's list ) and donald sutherland .",positive
693,"to be fair , the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written .",positive
694,"that said , however , there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work .",positive
695,"both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual .",positive
696,"narratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses .",positive
697,"although the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters .",positive
698,"at times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like "" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself "" become a little hard to swallow .",positive
699,"in addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel .",positive
700,"however , despite the negatives , i'm still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved .",positive
701,"the final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected .",positive
702,it's not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did .,positive
703,"at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself .",positive
704,"this is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it's a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours .",positive
705,"and , whatever you do , don't walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll .",positive
706,"james l . brooks , one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news , returns to the big screen with this entertaining , if slightly flawed comedy .",positive
707,"nicholson plays melvin udall , probably the most horrible person ever on the screen .",positive
708,"he's racist , homophobic , and never has a good word to say to anyone .",positive
709,"so , nobody talks to him , except waitress carol conelly ( t . v",positive
710,"sitcom star hunt , who was last seen in twister , 1996 ) .",positive
711,"naturally , udall , conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates , all hit it off in the end .",positive
712,"like good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 ) , even though the outcome is completely obvious , as good as it gets is an enjoyable , funny and warm comedy .",positive
713,"nicholson is hilarious as melvin , churning out insults with superb relish .",positive
714,only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers .,positive
715,"hunt is also good as waitress carol , and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson .",positive
716,there's also ( thankfully ) a bit of chemistry between them .,positive
717,"kinnear , as the gay neighbor , seems to have a slightly underwritten role , he's more of a plot convience than a character .",positive
718,"although his performance is good , his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together .",positive
719,"in fact , the scene stealer is simon's dog , who is funnier than nicholson .",positive
720,"but then again , pets are always cute on screen .",positive
721,"providing solid support is cuba gooding , jnr ( jerry maguire , 1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isn't as good as is character in maguire , he is still fun .",positive
722,"he overacts a little , but not so much as to be annoying .",positive
723,"smith is also good , although she has a fairly small role .",positive
724,"even director lawrence kasdan ( body heat , 1981 ) makes an appearance as a doctor .",positive
725,"but this is primarily nicholsons film , and every scene he's in , he's steals it .",positive
726,"he's character is so hateful , though , it's amazing that anyone talks to him at all , especially carol .",positive
727,and this is the films main problem .,positive
728,it's totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin .,positive
729,"she doesn't fall in love with him naturally , the film forces her to fall in love with him .",positive
730,"also , melvins character seems to go too nice , too quickly .",positive
731,"i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice , loving person .",positive
732,"it would take a helluva long time , much longer than this film would like to make out .",positive
733,"brooks direction is good , though , if a bit average , but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience .",positive
734,he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but generally he's good .,positive
735,there's also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer .,positive
736,"but , generally , as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do , which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie .",positive
737,"the movie is a bit overlong , but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly .",positive
738,"overall , as good as it gets is a fun movie , even though it may be unbelivable , and certainly worth seeing ( if just for jack nicholsons performance . )",positive
739,"not quite as good as it gets ( pardon the bad joke ) , but still good fun .",positive
740,after a stylistic detour with mrs .,positive
741,"parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption .",positive
742,"while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie .",positive
743,it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it .,positive
744,until mrs .,positive
745,"parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies .",positive
746,"i found equinox , his last pre- mrs .",positive
747,"parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating .",positive
748,"i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow .",positive
749,"there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach .",positive
750,"the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch .",positive
751,"in short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in .",positive
752,afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples .,positive
753,"jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) .",positive
754,"for her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level .",positive
755,all she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating .,positive
756,"after he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor .",positive
757,"the other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne .",positive
758,a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart .,positive
759,"they remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs .",positive
760,the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable .,positive
761,the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey .,positive
762,"the two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool .",positive
763,"meanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains .",positive
764,the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love .,positive
765,"sex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness .",positive
766,"ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves .",positive
767,"the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances .",positive
768,"jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman .",positive
769,those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity .,positive
770,"lara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability .",positive
771,"nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease .",positive
772,"the clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis .",positive
773,"her often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars .",positive
774,"i don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions .",positive
775,"enough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters .",positive
776,afterglow is basically a four-pronged character study .,positive
777,"the plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture .",positive
778,rudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction .,positive
779,""" the fugitive "" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made .",positive
780,"it takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that's totally believable throughout .",positive
781,"this isn't an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly .",positive
782,"harrison ford stars as dr . richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife .",positive
783,"the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner .",positive
784,we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble's perspective .,positive
785,"hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble's wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered .",positive
786,we don't get to see who the killer is until much further into the story .,positive
787,"in fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble's innocence ourselves .",positive
788,the film doesn't spend much time on the details of kimble's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story .,positive
789,one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck .,positive
790,"but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch .",positive
791,this movie is so incredible because it's able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable .,positive
792,"tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u . s . marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives .",positive
793,from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur .,positive
794,kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other .,positive
795,most of the film deals with richard's complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife .,positive
796,"ford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy's script and davis's outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is .",positive
797,"just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work is very interesting .",positive
798,"we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we .",positive
799,meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down .,positive
800,"at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them .",positive
801,he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery .,positive
802,one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor .,positive
803,there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) .,positive
804,"they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one-liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner .",positive
805,the final act concludes with another terrific chase .,positive
806,"richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him , and although we get a typical fight scene , the case is far from solved .",positive
807,"the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along , and we don't realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together .",positive
808,"maybe the finally scene is a bit much , but it still has a believable atmosphere to it .",positive
809,we're so relieved when justice is served .,positive
810,"it's not the plot is that makes "" the fugitive "" great , it's all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story .",positive
811,watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous .,positive
812,if only hollywood could produce more movies like this .,positive
813,"( 10/31/96 ) ( 1/29/97 ) ( 6/13/97 ) [see also : "" nick of time "" ]",positive
814,i think that any competent member of the human race who's ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer .,positive
815,"even though i try very hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen .",positive
816,but i don't care .,positive
817,not even a little .,positive
818,my reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great .,positive
819,2 ) drew barrymore is great .,positive
820,3 ) the movie is so funny .,positive
821,there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard .,positive
822,i haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers .,positive
823,"sandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music .",positive
824,"in the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness .",positive
825,"a week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone ) .",positive
826,"with his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress .",positive
827,"she is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months .",positive
828,julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans .,positive
829,"soon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other .",positive
830,"oh sure , it's trite .",positive
831,"and if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience .",positive
832,"what makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances .",positive
833,barrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) .,positive
834,"not only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written .",positive
835,"and the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i've ever seen .",positive
836,"naturally , the true star here is sandler .",positive
837,i think the guy is flat-out hilarious .,positive
838,"he can say something that just isn't funny , and his delivery makes me laugh .",positive
839,"his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy .",positive
840,"whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into .",positive
841,"as far as i'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents .",positive
842,and the movie is just so funny .,positive
843,perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him .,positive
844,this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air .,positive
845,"and while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half .",positive
846,my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important .,positive
847,"the film is predicable , but who cares ?",positive
848,"the characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable .",positive
849,"in addition to this , i can't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film .",positive
850,"in that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review .",positive
851,i just want everyone to know that i laughed .,positive
852,a lot .,positive
853,"based on the boris karloff's classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed . . . all while still alive .",positive
854,"recap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy .",positive
855,"problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . .",positive
856,"walking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good .",positive
857,"the visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all .",positive
858,"they pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi .",positive
859,"the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) .",positive
860,"unfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres .",positive
861,"on one hand , it is a fast paced action film .",positive
862,"on the other , it's a frightening horror film .",positive
863,"and on the side , it's a hilarious comedy .",positive
864,"ideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) .",positive
865,"the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner .",positive
866,"if they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep's entombment , that would be impossible .",positive
867,and then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies .,positive
868,"while really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy .",positive
869,replace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness .,positive
870,"while entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place .",positive
871,but at least it's a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of .,positive
872,"on the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience .",positive
873,but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn,positive
874,the sound down !,positive
875,"while a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you're not careful ) .",positive
876,"when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , "" end of days "" , it was so loud i couldn't make anything out .",positive
877,"on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with .",positive
878,"in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his "" giallo "" murder mysteries .",positive
879,"while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller .",positive
880,"the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book "" tenebrae "" .",positive
881,"with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems .",positive
882,the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa .,positive
883,"he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him .",positive
884,the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension .,positive
885,"argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business .",positive
886,tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here .,positive
887,it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play .,positive
888,in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes .,positive
889,"needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist .",positive
890,many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork .,positive
891,"they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria .",positive
892,"instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world .",positive
893,and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment .,positive
894,"so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question .",positive
895,"still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative .",positive
896,"some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated .",positive
897,"by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs .",positive
898,"about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious .",positive
899,"we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal .",positive
900,"he is insane , apparently .",positive
901,the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife .,positive
902,"he is finally revealed to us as this "" second killer "" in the film's bloody climax .",positive
903,"but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively .",positive
904,"you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house .",positive
905,"but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway .",positive
906,bad cutting puts the timing way out .,positive
907,"in other words , he's almost in two places at once .",positive
908,during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring .,positive
909,by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant .,positive
910,the injury ?,positive
911,he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock !,positive
912,"thus , the revelation of the "" hero "" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled .",positive
913,"helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along .",positive
914,"but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least .",positive
915,"the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage .",positive
916,tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies .,positive
917,"for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike .",positive
918,"we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too !",positive
919,"that's careless filmmaking , pure and simple .",positive
920,"why , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ?",positive
921,"because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world .",positive
922,take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae .,positive
923,an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town .,positive
924,"finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair .",positive
925,"it's an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone .",positive
926,and that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating .,positive
927,"too often , it seems , argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts .",positive
928,"mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look .",positive
929,and if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential .,positive
930,see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli .,positive
931,"it's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative .",positive
932,"a shame , because it doesn't have to be that way .",positive
933,"take argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache .",positive
934,"proof that he can do it , if he tries . . .",positive
935,"as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult .",positive
936,parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives .,positive
937,"but if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome .",positive
938,`affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood .,positive
939,the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) .,positive
940,here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface .,positive
941,he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me .,positive
942,"but as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head .",positive
943,we see that he is a mean-tempered person .,positive
944,"he has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him .",positive
945,"he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence .",positive
946,he also has tremendous problems with relationships .,positive
947,he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter .,positive
948,but his bearish persona and stature alienates her .,positive
949,he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him .,positive
950,his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk .,positive
951,"she tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point .",positive
952,"finally , he is spiteful and vindictive .",positive
953,"as a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless .",positive
954,"as the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died .",positive
955,we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain .,positive
956,he is a prisoner and a slave to it .,positive
957,he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension .,positive
958,what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ?,positive
959,we learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) .,positive
960,this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet .,positive
961,he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist .,positive
962,we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks .,positive
963,"to heighten the father's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person .",positive
964,very effective .,positive
965,"today , wade's dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man .",positive
966,"the influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade .",positive
967,the result is every son's nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be .,positive
968,"this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama , and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity .",positive
969,he's a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father .,positive
970,coburn displays heft as the bitter dad .,positive
971,"but , it's most certainly not saturday-night-friendly fare .",positive
972,there's nothing light or fluffy about this film .,positive
973,that may turn many moviegoers away .,positive
974,but it's certainly worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing nolte's and coburn's raw acting talents .,positive
975,is evil dead ii a bad movie ?,positive
976,"it's full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release .",positive
977,explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult .,positive
978,`well what's it about ? ',positive
979,"`five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly , hairy , wart covered monsters . '",positive
980,`come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week .,positive
981,why should i see it again ? ',positive
982,"`no evil dead ii is different , it's funny . '",positive
983,`it's funny to see people die ?,positive
984,are you sick or something ? ',positive
985,maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie .,positive
986,"his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious .",positive
987,an example of raimi's odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash's girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound .,positive
988,"sure it's over-the-top , but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet .",positive
989,"the whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster .",positive
990,"the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , the more amusing it becomes .",positive
991,"no matter how sick it may sound , it is funny to watch bruce ampbell's ash get his butt kicked every five minutes .",positive

1044,"however , he still smokes his lucky strikes , detests all forms of authority , and kills at a whim .",negative
1045,"beyond that , the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page-turner by spillane , probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers .",negative
1046,"the movie starts off with a bang : a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series , complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti ( "" rocky "" ) .",negative
1047,"after that , the movie and the book begin the same , with the murder of jack williams ( frederick downs ) , a one-armed detective and hammer's best friend .",negative
1048,"hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack's death , and with the help of his devoted secretary , the blond and shapely velda ( laurene landon ) , and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief pat chambers ( paul sorvino ) , he is immediately on the killer's trail .",negative
1049,"here the movie splits completely from the book , and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia , the cia , one of hammer's vietnam vet buddies , and a kinky sex clinic .",negative
1050,"many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie , but they take on slightly different roles .",negative
1051,"for instance , charles kalecki ( alan king ) , a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book , turns into a suave mob boss .",negative
1052,"and , more importantly , hammer's suspicious love interest , charlotte bennett ( barbara carrera ) , morphs from a run-of-the-mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic .",negative
1053,""" i , the jury "" is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane's books ( including a 1953 version which was made in 3-d ) , but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way : it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood's production code .",negative
1054,"although this takes the 1982 version of "" i , the jury "" closer to the core of the original subject matter , it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism , because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book .",negative
1055,"rest assured , the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity , but it is thoroughly violent , especially toward women .",negative
1056,"it features one woman having her neck slashed , a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia ( judson scott ) , and another woman shot point-blank in the belly by hammer himself .",negative
1057,"no one would deny that spillane's writing has a definite misogynistic nature , but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment ; its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling .",negative
1058,"it's no surprise that the movie , like the book , fades to black with a dead woman on the floor .",negative
1059,""" i , the jury "" had a troubled production and was not well-supported by the studio that made it , which is one explanation why it didn't do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made .",negative

1061,"cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well , but he was yanked from the director's chair after only a week's worth of shooting because he was already $100 , 000 over budget .",negative

1065,"cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer , but heffron has none .",negative
1066,"he shot the movie quickly and clumsily , and although some scenes ring true , most of them are flat , trite , and invariably dull .",negative
1067,"the movie features numerous car chases , shoot-outs , and stunts , but heffron's background in television is the dominant tone ; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal nudity , "" i , the jury , "" takes on the air of a made-for-tv quickie , with no real punch or depth .",negative
1068,"but the problems in "" i , the jury "" run deeper than the technical .",negative
1069,"the central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties .",negative
1070,"because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer's character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona .",negative
1071,we never really get that impression in the movie -- there is no first-person voice-over narration and some scenes don't have hammer in them at all .,negative
1072,"consequently , a great deal of the texture of spillane's storytelling is lost .",negative
1073,the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer's moral code is thrown to the wind .,negative
1074,"despite his characterization as a hard-nosed , violent , misogynistic killer , hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code .",negative
1075,"the title itself , "" i , the jury , "" refers to his anti-establishment notion of being his own law .",negative
1076,"unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police , hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment .",negative
1077,"in this way , he can be seen as "" above the law , "" but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct , his own morality .",negative
1078,"the movie forgoes that aspect of his character , and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society's terms , but in any terms , especially his own .",negative
1079,"if anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful .",negative
1080,"maybe the scene was intended for laughs , but it only cheapens hammer's character and is , by all accounts , a lousy way to start the movie .",negative
1081,"the blame for hammer's character can't be laid on assante's shoulders , because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon-like mumbling , he delivers a fine performance .",negative
1082,"spillane never once described hammer's physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared , so any actor could conceivably portray him .",negative
1083,"of course , because of the lack of written description , those who have read spillane's books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like , and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( spillane , who played the character himself in 1963's "" the girl hunters , "" is generally considered the best of the film hammers ) .",negative
1084,the rest of actors are most un-noteworthy .,negative
1085,"with the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino , everyone who appeared in "" i , the jury "" were up-and-comers who basically went nowhere .",negative
1086,"many of them ended up working in television ( like carrera , who had a short stint on "" dallas "" in the mid-eighties ) , which only adds to the made-for-tv atmosphere of the film .",negative

1088,"nostalgia for the 70s continues , as we see a revival of one of the decade's greatest achievements : the marijuana comedy .",negative

1194,"scenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting .",negative
1195,perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive .,negative
1196,"the basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny .",negative

1199,"the addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive .",negative

1206,"this $100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull , long winded , and a huge disappointment .",negative
1207,"considering the huge budget , the all star cast , and a story by crichton , sphere is majorly disappointing .",negative
1208,"the film opens with norman goodman ( hoffman ) , a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors .",negative
1209,"however , when he arrives , he his told by supervisor barnes ( peter coyote ) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft .",negative
1210,"along with goodman is mathematician harry adams ( jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( stone ) and ted fielding ( liev schrieber . )",negative
1211,"they investigate the spaceship , find a massive sphere inside , meet an alien intelligence called jerry , and basically weird crap happens .",negative
1212,"unfortunately , something went wrong along the way with sphere .",negative
1213,"the film starts off entertaining enough , but throughout this very long movie , it just gets sillier and sillier .",negative
1214,"the film jaunts along from scene to scene , never fully explaining what is going on .",negative
1215,"the actors and directing don't help , either .",negative
1216,"hoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie , churning out dull lines , and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie .",negative
1217,"stone is useless , displaying no emotion , and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman .",negative
1218,"the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson , who's funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere .",negative
1219,"but he's hardly in it , and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone .",negative
1220,"the same goes for peter coyote , who hams it up as the officer , but is then killed off halfway through .",negative
1221,"the director , barry levinson , who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure ( 1994 ) messes up with the drama and the action .",negative
1222,"the drama scenes are , quite frankly , boring , and the action scenes suffer from overkill , with levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful speed 2 , 1997 )",negative
1223,"the writing doesn't help much , either .",negative
1224,"although crichton is great with plots , he's terrible with dialogue , and practically every line in sphere is a dud .",negative
1225,"the speech is too simple , i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent .",negative

1227,none of it is smart .,negative

1230,"there's a giant squid attack in the picture , but not once does the audience see the squid , even though the film has a massive budget .",negative
1231,"i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid , and if handled correctly it probably would .",negative
1232,"but the whole scene is done badly , and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid .",negative
1233,"finally , the film has no idea what genre to be .",negative
1234,levison can't handle his own plot .,negative
1235,"it leaps from hokey sci-fi , to horror , and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller .",negative
1236,"and , of course , the film is very much like the abyss ( 1988 ) , although in it's defense , crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released ( and is far superior to this rubbish . )",negative
1237,it's not all that bad though .,negative
1238,"the plot is all right , there's a few jump scenes ( although nothing very scary ) and there's the occasionally interesting bit .",negative

1240,not really worth seeing .,negative
1241,overall rating= review by david wilcock,negative
1242,"director luis mandoki's last film was the superb , serious 1994 drama "" when a man loves a woman , "" but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture , "" message in a bottle , "" which is the worst type of romance , a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up .",negative
1243,"everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before---and much better---so there's an absence of suspense , and the film ultimately moves at such a very , very deliberate pace , as if it is trying to make great , "" meaningful "" statements and plot developments , that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through .",negative
1244,""" message in a bottle "" begins with theresa osborne ( robin wright penn ) , a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune , whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day .",negative
1245,"inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine , and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and , to her objection , finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper .",negative
1246,"soon , a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message , and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake , theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks , a boating town in north carolina , to find out the specifics of the message .",negative
1247,"of course , garrett turns out to be a handsome , rugged man around theresa's age and played by kevin costner .",negative
1248,"she is immediately charmed by him , but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there , and finds that catherine was garrett's late wife who died a few years earlier .",negative
1249,do you think you know where this is headed ?,negative
1250,"most likely you do , and i wouldn't call it giving away anything to say that by the picture's end , the movie has fallen into deep , artificial melodrama that i didn't buy for a second .",negative
1251,"if there are any positive things to say about "" message in a bottle , "" it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett's stubborn , but loving father , are far above par to be in such a wasteful , "" shaggy dog "" love story , and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast , and paints chicago as an equally alluring city .",negative
1252,"meanwhile , costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has made recently .",negative
1253,"it seems that with such bad luck , he wouldn't want to make another movie set near water , but here he is again with one of the main , and most ridiculous , centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea .",negative
1254,"the other actors are all , sadly , wasted , including illeana douglas , an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the "" friend "" roles , here playing penn's confidante and co-worker at the tribune .",negative
1255,"the first half of "" message in a bottle "" plays like a hum-drum , trite television movie for the lifetime channel , as theresa spends a great deal of time "" getting to know "" garrett , with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining .",negative
1256,"usually , i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships , but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt "" written , "" and not as if people were really "" talking . """,negative
1257,"when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other , and are not particularly interesting themselves , you know immediately that you are in trouble .",negative
1258,"i swear that while watching "" message in a bottle , "" i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater ( heck , in actuality i'm not even familiar to the novel this is based on , by nicholas sparks ) .",negative
1259,"always one step ahead of the characters , the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true hollywood melodrama , the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing .",negative
1260,"nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa's secret , and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after .",negative
1261,"this same exact problem occurred in last year's very , very similar ( watch this , and you will realize just how similar i mean ) meg ryan-nicolas cage romantic drama , "" city of angels . """,negative
1262,"although theresa is deeply touched by the "" heartfelt "" letter that she finds in the bottle , perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own , preferably before filming began .",negative
1263,"it should have read , "" memo to screenwriters : use you brain ! """,negative
1264,i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago .,negative
1265,i guess my memory really sucks .,negative
1266,"there is very , very little that is funny in caddyshack .",negative
1267,"the laughs are few , and far between , and what there are really aren't that great .",negative
1268,"caddyshack , as the name implies , more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club .",negative
1269,michael o'keefe plays said caddy .,negative
1270,"why they cast this unknown , fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me .",negative
1271,"the movie doesn't seem to have a real plot , just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera .",negative
1272,"the only real story , if you can call it that , was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper , bill murray , who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course .",negative
1273,most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera -- with painfully limited success .,negative
1274,"bill murray is slightly amusing in places , but fairly wasted .",negative
1275,"the biggest waste of all is chevy chase , who didn't even crack a smile on my face with his character's lame zen-like approach to golfing .",negative
1276,"there are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight , but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie .",negative
1277,i guess that's what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid .,negative
1278,"i'm not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of , but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper .",negative
1279,nothing about this movie works .,negative
1280,it wouldn't have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasn't going to fly .,negative
1281,most of the scenes just couldn't possibly be funny .,negative
1282,it's as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world .,negative
1283,i'm sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny .,negative
1284,"in reality , they were painfully embarrassing to watch .",negative
1285,"there is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the "" hot babe "" of the movie walking by in her bikini .",negative
1286,olive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl .,negative
1287,everything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned .,negative
1288,maybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny .,negative
1289,"but for the rest of us , stay the hell away from caddyshack .",negative
1290,tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse .,negative
1291,the fugitive ?,negative
1292,"not quite ? this is the plot for double jeopardy , another fugitive copycat without the action , excitement , and good acting that the original had .",negative
1293,"there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good ; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall , clever huh ?",negative
1294,oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband ( bruce greenwood ) who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man .,negative
1295,both movies are on video .,negative
1296,make the wise choice and pick the fugitive .,negative
1297,"there are so many flaws in double jeopardy , it is laughable .",negative
1298,"while serving time in prison , libby parsons ( judd ) discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice .",negative
1299,"learning that her husband is still alive , she decides to serve her time in prison , find him , retrieve her son , and kill her husband if necessary .",negative
1300,"when the strict parole officer travis lehman ( jones ) stands in her way , libby decides to break the rules ( who knows why ? ) and continue her plan , despite the fact that if she gets caught , she's going back to jail .",negative
1301,director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son .,negative
1302,"every other scene , we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture .",negative
1303,"in an action movie like this , valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something .",negative
1304,"all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend "" i miss my son . """,negative
1305,"nothing more , nothing less .",negative
1306,"dr . kimble of the fugitive didn't look at one picture of his dead wife , his primary concern was to save himself .",negative
1307,libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough .,negative
1308,"ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this , they will be typecast for the rest of their careers , kind of like their doomed co-star tommy lee jones .",negative
1309,winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilty roles .,negative
1310,people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right .,negative
1311,though i don't think he will win another oscar again .,negative
1312,the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons .,negative
1313,"even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer , the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count .",negative
1314,"burglary , assault , grand theft auto are some of libby's slipups .",negative
1315,the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you're innocent of the major crime .,negative
1316,hopefully criminals won't use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent .,negative
1317,that would just be plain stupid .,negative
1318,"while i am not fond of any writer's use of cheap , easy puns , i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it ( witness my review of _pecker_ from a couple of issues ago ) .",negative
1319,"so here goes : the juvenile , college-set black comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival .",negative
1320,"strait-laced med student josh ( tom everett scott , who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout ) 's blemish-free academic record breaks out into fs , thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate , cooper ( mark-paul gosselaar ) , who introduces josh to the sex- and booze-filled nights that come with university life .",negative
1321,"with the threat of losing an academic scholarship ( josh ) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming ( cooper ) , what are two good-hearted slackers to do ?",negative
1322,"easy--look for a loophole , which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student's ( or students' ) roommate commits suicide , the surviving student ( s ) shall receive straight as .",negative
1323,"so instead of studying , josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there , move him into their dorm room , and drive him to suicide before the semester ends .",negative
1324,director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper's diabolical plot .,negative
1325,"until then , the usual boring cliches of college life ( booze , sex , more booze ) fill the time , which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar's sitcom-bred mugging .",negative
1326,"that said , once cohn and company do build some comic momentum , they mishandle it .",negative
1327,"the introduction of the manic , psychotic cliff ( lochlyn munro ) , a potential roommate for josh and cooper , brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates : paranoid nerd buckley ( randy pearlstein ) and british death rocker matt ( corey page ) .",negative
1328,"one wishes that cliff would reappear , but , as they say , be careful what you wish for .",negative
1329,"not surprisingly , he does resurface , and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose ; almost immediately , his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty .",negative
1330,the same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ .,negative
1331,"whatever morbid appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates , and the self-absorbed characters , especially cooper , pretty much grate from the get-go .",negative
1332,_dead_man_ doesn't grow tiresome ; it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through .,negative
1333,"as it slogs along to a cheesy , happy-for-all-parties conclusion , _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die , it still insists on going on . . .",negative

1336,"keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together , the director of the fugitive ( andrew davis ) back again to give us another thriller , and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot .",negative

1348,"so he murders the project leader , blows up the project ( great but short scene here , sort of like a mini id4 city-devastation thing ) and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hi-tech hush-hush location .",negative
1349,"unfortunately , our intrepid machinist and an english physicist ( weisz ) manage to get away and now follows a fugitive-like chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script .",negative

1351,"both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesn't change much , i guess we can't really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere .",negative
1352,"the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones , chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward .",negative
1353,"credit to them , but we aren't really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters .",negative
1354,"where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy , eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves' character is never given the time to develop .",negative

1549,she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner .,negative
1550,the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title .,negative
1551,"not even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese .",negative
1552,"it's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it's oddly fascinating .",negative

1569,this movie is really stupid .,negative
1570,it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief .,negative
1571,"also , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston .",negative

1578,"the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me .",negative
1579,"the movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing .",negative
1580,"as stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time .",negative
1581,the rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt .,negative
1582,the face-painting that's occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind .,negative
1583,this movie also suffers from its new age trappings .,negative
1584,"maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music .",negative
1585,"add to this the film's faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you'd expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious .",negative

1592,the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie .,negative
1593,"however , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality .",negative

1599,"actors who demand such salaries might be greedy , but in some instances they are quite justified , because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation .",negative
1600,"proof for that can be found even in the realm of low-budget movies , and one fine example is breakaway , 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring ( in ) famous figure skater tonya harding .",negative
1601,"face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie's poster , but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra , attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster .",negative

1603,"realising that her life suddenly became worthless , myra starts running for her life , followed by professional assassins .",negative
1604,terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater .,negative
1605,"although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities , her acting leaves much to be desired .",negative
1606,"on the other hand , her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality , believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b-films a bad name .",negative
1607,"martin sheen's brother joe estevez , whose character looks like he had entered from another movies' set , is the only bright spot of breakaway .",negative
1608,"unfortunately , he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding's silver screen debut proved to be her last film .",negative
1609,"movies like six days , seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford , anne heche , and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents . ?",negative
1610,"the script was written by michael browning , and he decided that , instead of thinking up new ideas , he'd rehash a lot of cliches , omit even the slightest bit of character development , and then throw in drug-dealing pirates to provide for a few high-level action sequences and explosions . ?",negative

1627,"we'll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc ? e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo , and then he can feel guilty . ?",negative
1628,"then , when anne heche kisses harrison ford ( they have to kiss , because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie ) , it will be a vindicated action , because her fianc ? e will already have cheated on her ! ?",negative
1629,"then , for no obvious reason , they'll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them . ?",negative
1630,"oh , yes ! ?",negative
1631,i feel so good about this story . ?,negative
1632,"instead of using characterization to propel the events , it will be completely random , and yet totally predictable ! ?",negative
1633,imagine that .,negative
1634,"don't get me wrong -- six days , seven nights is not a boring picture ; ford and heche both do a great job . ?",negative
1635,"the sparks fly between them , and so most of browning's inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors' sheer force of talent .",negative
1636,"? almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen , and i found myself laughing pretty hard . ?",negative
1637,"schwimmer is also funny , and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get . ?",negative
1638,"and reitman , who has made some good films , at least tries to make things exciting . ?",negative
1639,"even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb , i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences .",negative
1640,it's just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces . ?,negative
1641,the picture feels like it's been hacked to pieces -- i wouldn't be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely . ?,negative
1642,"the ones that are here are as bad as they come ( i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships ) , and i'd just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream , "" why did you pick this awful script ! ? "" ?",negative
1643,"the film is outright stupid , but some of the elements are subtly horrifying . ?",negative
1644,"for instance , take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo , and then feels really guilty . ?",negative
1645,"this is a serious problem in real life , but six days , seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device : ? his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford . ?",negative
1646,"in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety , i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story .",negative
1647,"this is summer movie season , but that doesn't mean our movies have to be dumb . ?",negative

1689,"the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she's kind of cute , so let's start the bleeding !",negative

1701,"what's worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible .",negative
1702,"first of all , the film doesn't even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ?",negative
1703,"how come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ?",negative
1704,"actually , i'm not sure what frankie was posessed by .",negative
1705,"supposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) .",negative
1706,which one is it ?,negative
1707,"the answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time .",negative
1708,"furthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church .",negative

1716,"i'm not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story .",negative
1717,maybe it's an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever .,negative
1718,"the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over .",negative
1719,"like so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill .",negative
1720,"so much is overdone in "" stigmata , "" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film's ( many ) flaws .",negative

1726,"of course , wood's career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent .",negative
1727,"boorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain "" zardoz "" ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful "" exorcist ii : the heretic "" ) .",negative
1728,"boorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn't know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent .",negative

1733,""" zardoz "" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman's .",negative
1734,"his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even "" the wizard of oz , "" a book which figures into the movie's plot .",negative
1735,"but , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling .",negative
1736,"the events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found .",negative
1737,"in fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions .",negative
1738,it's more middle ages than space age .,negative
1739,"the world of "" zardoz "" is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life .",negative
1740,"these immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society .",negative
1741,"however , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years .",negative
1742,"if someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals .",negative

1753,"i say "" hilarious "" because that is exactly what "" zardoz "" is .",negative
1754,"it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn't get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming .",negative
1755,"just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker .",negative
1756,"boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of "" deliverance , "" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort .",negative
1757,"he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( "" 2001 "" ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in "" zardoz "" besides the inadvertent humor .",negative

1770,"my recommendation is that , unless you are a big fan of the kids , skip the film .",negative
1771,"as it is , their first--and most likely only--attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv .",negative

1781,"the best thing about sketch comedy--and the kids are no exception--is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs , then go on to another quick skit .",negative
1782,"but with the additional set-up necessary in telling a longer , coherent story , the laughs just dont come fast enough .",negative
1783,"strangely , the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv .",negative
1784,the movie makes several attempts at risqueness--mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters--but they seem almost forced ; as if they have to live up to a pg rating .,negative

1804,"the non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed , without any interesting camera work , which is usually a trademark of carpenter's .",negative

1806,"there is no story development , and there isn't even an attempt to flesh out the characters .",negative

1808,"daniel baldwin has some potential , but his character comes off as being very dense .",negative

1810,"there is not an ounce of intelligence , or excitement in , "" john carpenter's vamires , "" which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan of carpenter's .",negative
