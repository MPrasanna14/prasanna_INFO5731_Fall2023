1,the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters .,negative
2,"they were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status .",negative
3,"with john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive .",negative
4,"it feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work .",negative
5,"the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence .",negative
6,"even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction .",negative
7,"willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else .",negative
8,"christopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression .",negative
9,"with no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about .",negative
10,"cinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration .",negative
11,"sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about .",negative
12,"in the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about .",negative
13,"okay , bear with me y'all , cause first off i have to get this off my chest :",negative
14,what the hell is up with that damn crab ? ? ?,negative
15,whew . okay .,negative
16,"cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end , as cute as the crab maybe .",negative
17,even i know that you need more footage than * that * .,negative
18,and that wasn't the only thing getting on my nerves .,negative
19,"the cutesy gimmicks , saccharine sweet score / soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar ( as amanda ) and sean patrick flannery ( as tom ) might have held some appeal during , oh , say the first 10 minutes of the movie .",negative
20,"at first the movie moves along at a quick , interesting pace .",negative
21,"it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street , whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * doesn't * die .",negative
22,"a ridiculous concept , yes , but at this point i'm willing to accept it because i'm willing to accept that this is how amanda's life is changed , how her powers are received .",negative
23,"later on , the movie can't seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom .",negative
24,"and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying ; they weren't just repetitive , they were out of place and unnecessary .",negative
25,"the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed , sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development ( amanda suddenly becoming a great chef , her falling in love with tom , etc . ) , sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good .",negative
26,"some places the plot just doesn't make sense , sometimes it's way too contrived ( the crab bit , for example ) , and sometimes too corny ( peaches emitting dry ice .",negative
27,can't beat that ) .,negative
28,"all in all the plot seemed fragmented , unconnected .",negative
29,"not romantic at all , and only funny in some places .",negative
30,"so , okay , do the magic powers come from the crab ?",negative
31,or the fairy godfather ?,negative
32,she can * float * now too ?,negative
33,"and all of a sudden , instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches , she can put her emotions into her food ?",negative
34,"tom all of a sudden just accepts amanda's "" witchcraft "" in the end ?",negative
35,would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac's video ?,negative
36,what the hell is up with that damn crab ?,negative
37,"it is unfortunate , because i liked the basic premise of the movie , until it became too fantastical and tiresome .",negative
38,"the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while , but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables .",negative
39,"the humor was good in some places ( nolan gets the funniest bits , including that incomprehensible , totally random thing with the dolls ) .",negative
40,"gellar and flannery are qualified actors , and gellar has a particular charm , but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy ( or even annette in the upcoming "" cruel intentions "" ) than this sorry excuse for a character .",negative
41,"it's almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is , or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible .",negative
42,"the supporting character nolan was a highlight , though he reminded me a bit of kevin in "" you've got mail "" ( see footnotes ) .",negative
43,"and , as always , typical of a chick flick / romantic comedy , there's a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background , cued up at all the right places .",negative
44,"this sort of got on the nerves after a while , too .",negative
45,""" simply irresistible "" is not hard to understand , light , funny in some places , and generally disappointing because it can't draw the line between romance and protracted sap , between humor and tired slapstick .",negative
46,and how could i refrain from making a pun ?,negative
47,.,negative
48,.,negative
49,.,negative
50,""" simply irresistible "" is all too easy to resist .",negative
51,"( first viewing , 2/6/99 )",negative

53,business rivals fall in love .,negative
54,female counterpart's business is in danger of being shut down .,negative
55,female as mother- like figure guiding her .,negative
56,"the annoying , hysterical ex-girlfriends .",negative
57,* i _really_ like sarah michelle gellar's wardrobe .,negative
58,i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes .,negative
59,"the original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor .",negative
60,"unfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed .",negative
61,"as the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie .",negative
62,"it's a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film .",negative
63,"during this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website .",negative
64,the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously .,negative
65,"we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies .",negative
66,we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him .,negative
67,we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him .,negative
68,"no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again .",negative
69,"i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie .",negative
70,"the movie cuts again , this time to the present .",negative
71,"the young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there's no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the "" blair witch hunt , "" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website .",negative
72,"we meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience .",negative
73,"steven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria .",negative
74,"tristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence .",negative
75,she is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly .,negative
76,"( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out .",negative
77,how did i know ?,negative
78,"because in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant . )",negative
79,"the fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil .",negative
80,they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery .,negative
81,"kim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch .",negative
82,presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it's never explained .,negative
83,the party of five heads off into the woods as promised .,negative
84,"they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr's house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night's events .",negative
85,"there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere .",negative
86,"the movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down .",negative
87,"sexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens .",negative
88,this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary .,negative
89,"the next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen's manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow .",negative
90,"the videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , "" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! """,negative
91,ooh .,negative
92,spooky .,negative
93,the team goes back to jeffrey's house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes .,negative
94,they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night .,negative
95,wacky hijinks ensue .,negative
96,"tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket .",negative
97,"throughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about "" reverse , "" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards .",negative
98,"when they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours .",negative
99,( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes .,negative
100,"okay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves . . . oh ,",negative
101,nevermind . ),negative
102,this movie was awful .,negative
103,simply awful .,negative
104,the characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development .,negative
105,erica is the nature-loving wiccan .,negative
106,tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman .,negative
107,steven is the overbearing asshole .,negative
108,kim is the antisocial goth girl .,negative
109,"old , tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures .",negative
110,how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ?,negative
111,because she's pregnant !,negative
112,how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl ?,negative
113,because she wears a lot of eye makeup !,negative
114,how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ?,negative
115,"because he has jagged teeth and talks like he's straight out of "" deliverance "" !",negative
116,this is weak storytelling at its worst .,negative
117,"rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic , the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics , in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action .",negative
118,it didn't work .,negative
119,"on top of being poorly developed , most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid .",negative
120,"( "" honey , you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie .",negative
121,"let's get on a plane home . """,negative
122,""" no .",negative
123,"i am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what's going on . """,negative
124,""" ok . "" )",negative
125,"frankly , by the end of the movie , i was rooting for the witch .",negative
126,i also felt that there was simply too much blood 'n' gore in this film .,negative
127,the first movie worked by never showing us the horror .,negative
128,"the witch was a palpable presence in that movie , but we never saw it ; we never saw anything , in fact .",negative
129,"the horror was all off-screen , and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be .",negative
130,this is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie .,negative
131,blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross-out .,negative
132,"this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey's throat , and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort .",negative
133,"knives plunge into flesh , bloody fingers trail off into the darkness , and none of it is explained until the very end , when it was too late for me to care .",negative
134,"this movie didn't stop with showing us the gore , either ; it went for broke and showed us everything .",negative
135,"by the end of the movie , there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours .",negative
136,"it is all explained ; in fact , it is all shown on-screen in loving detail .",negative
137,"i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster , or see only brief glimpses , mere suggestions of what the monster is ; it is not because i find the monster so terrifying , but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying .",negative
138,"i have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no "" monster , "" that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind .",negative
139,"i found this to be a miserably poor explanation ; if it was in fact the director's intent , then he needs to have some words with the writer , because it was not made clear at all .",negative
140,( i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds ; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so .,negative
141,"and if there was no witch , then what about the vanishing tree ?",negative
142,the snowfall of manuscript paper ?,negative
143,hm ? ),negative
144,blair witch 2 : book of shadows was a horrible movie .,negative
145,"from the poorly-written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross-out shots , it was a bad effort through and through .",negative
146,i'm giving this stinker .,negative
147,"normally , the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be .",negative
148,"but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is , compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive , helped me come to the big goose egg .",negative
149,"i'm not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing , or if he was even thinking at all .",negative
150,maybe in mel's little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny .,negative
151,"in mine , it's not .",negative
152,or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking .,negative
153,because only the self-righteous lee uses the n-word more often in his films than brooks did in this one .,negative
154,at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing .,negative
155,brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it .,negative
156,wrong mel !,negative
157,"i would call you a boob mel , but that insults breasts everywhere .",negative
158,this idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor's ( harvey korman ) attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad .,negative
159,he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out .,negative
160,"but the town appeals to the governor ( mel brooks in one of many uninspired , and unfunny roles ) to send them a new sheriff to protect them .",negative
161,the governor pawns the task off to korman's character hedley lamarr .,negative
162,( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name . ),negative
163,lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff ( gasp ) in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave .,negative
164,"hold on , i've got to stop while these gales of laughter pass .",negative
165,it's just too funny .,negative
166,racism passing as humor -- gosh why didn't anybody ever think of that one before ?,negative
167,"oh wait , i think somebody might have -- they are called the kkk .",negative
168,i'm not calling brooks a racist -- but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldn't know what was funny if it hit him over the head .,negative
169,but i digress .,negative
170,"anyway , the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the n-word .",negative
171,"golly , will the hilarity just never end ?",negative
172,"he ends up joining forces with a drunk ( gene wilder ) , who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west .",negative
173,"together , they save the day from evil .",negative
174,not one person in this movie gives a decent performance .,negative
175,"wilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie , and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie .",negative
176,"ok , he really didn't -- but he should have .",negative
177,the films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day .,negative
178,i did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience .,negative
179,i admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions .,negative
180,"actually , the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise , but alas , it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie .",negative
181,i can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever .,negative
182,mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film .,negative
183,2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off .,negative
184,it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways .,negative
185,"i'm not going into much greater detail than that , since it would take forever to explain , and quite frankly , i'm not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that i've already wasted .",negative
186,"while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction , 2 days in the valley falls way short .",negative
187,"this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello , james spader and jeff daniels .",negative
188,"while the story isn't much , and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better , 2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots .",negative
189,"james spader's character , while not much better than the rest , is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way .",negative
190,and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron ( in her first role ) .,negative
191,you know a movie isn't that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women .,negative
192,even if they are both gorgeous .,negative
193,i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted .,negative
194,but marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result .,negative
195,"while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting , they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about .",negative
196,"if i were to put a number on it , only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch .",negative
197,"this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent , and even then prepare for disappointment .",negative
198,not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again .,negative
199,or at least not all of it anyway .,negative
200,what would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a movie ?,negative
201,"a better question , what would inspire a studio to produce said movie ?",negative
202,"if you have an answer , let me know .",negative
203,"foolish , the new movie written by and starring master p is a jaw-droppingly horrible film , one with no redeeming value socially , cinematically or otherwise .",negative
204,"comedically it has some potential , but only in its stand-up comedy moments , which i can turn on comedy central for .",negative
205,master p stars as fifty dollah' ( beat that ! ) as a mobster ( i think ) who is trying to start a comedy club/act with his little brother foolish ( eddie griffin ) .,negative
206,"but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss ( played by andrew dice clay , for the very first time entertaining ) , a stubborn club owner and family problems ( the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert's "" idiot plot , "" if everyone here wasn't an idiot , there would be no problem )",negative
207,so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names ?,negative
208,not a hell of a lot .,negative
209,"as i have mentioned , master p cannot act or write .",negative
210,he acts like the rapper that he is .,negative
211,"the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced , as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro .",negative
212,"as for his script -- well , i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience .",negative
213,"if you haven't yet figured it out , that is not saying much .",negative
214,co-star eddie griffin ( really the star of the show ) is quite a different story .,negative
215,"the fact of the matter is that griffin , whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network , is an extremely talented comedian , stand-up and otherwise .",negative
216,"he has much in common with chris tucker ( rush hour , money talks ) in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips .",negative
217,"he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity ( to the extent which that can be done ) , and while i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie .",negative
218,"and indeed , i laughed at a few stand-up scenes here , but from a feature-length movie i expect more .",negative
219,foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters .,negative
220,"every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke ( in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers , foolish blurts out towards his jewelry-sporting sibling "" you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush "" ) or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car ( to which i said , a bit too loudly for the occasion "" huh ? "" ) after getting slightly upset with his wife .",negative
221,believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard-earned $8 .,negative
222,you'll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you don't have cable .,negative
223,"eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative ( although offensive ) yarn , but everyone else should stay the hell away .",negative
224,&#137 ;,negative
225,synopsis : a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar .,negative
226,"the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary , while his wife disapproves .",negative
227,"meanwhile , a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession .",negative
228,comments : why is this movie called possessed by the night ?,negative
229,it's hard to speculate .,negative
230,"most of this film takes place during the day , and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky , pulsating , bubbling brain thingie in a jar .",negative
231,"in case you haven't picked up on this yet , possessed by the night is a bottom-of-the-barrel "" thriller "" ( i use the term "" thriller "" loosely here ) which is really cheap and bad .",negative
232,"the plot , which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s , actually serves one purpose : to exploit nude women as often as possible .",negative
233,writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging .,negative
234,there's really not much to say .,negative
235,"the acting is lousy ; although , occasionally , the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience .",negative
236,"most humorous is frank sivero , who plays murray , the novelist's agent .",negative
237,he is so horrible in this role that one can't help but be amused .,negative
238,the plot sucks .,negative
239,"nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession , even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole .",negative
240,the dialogue stinks .,negative
241,"a loan shark , for instance , tells another how much he loves bimbos , which is something the audience really doesn't need to know .",negative
242,"everything about possessed by the night is second rate , even the film credits .",negative
243,"as the names of the not-so-talented film crew scrolled by at the end , joseph scales came up , credited as being "" assistsant to foley artist . """,negative
244,someone could have used an editor !,negative
245,"to be honest , the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes .",negative
246,"playboy playmate shannon tweed , after all , is the star here .",negative
247,"i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing , he would like this movie .",negative
248,why did i give this turkey two stars and not one ?,negative
249,"as a bad movie , it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film .",negative
250,"if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night , however , i'd recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else .",negative
251,"okay , okay .",negative
252,"maybe i wasn't in the mood to watch a mindless action movie ; i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii , even while admitting that it wasn't as good as the others .",negative
253,"howewer , the latest segal picture didn't look that bad , and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them , i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash .",negative
254,"boy , was i wrong !",negative

496,perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics .,negative
497,"the setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for .",negative
498,"he wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background .",negative

556,the plot is another issue entirely .,negative
557,"o'fallon is someone whom i'm betting has seen reservoir dogs and the usual suspects too many times , for not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence they never return ( do we really need the scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with a toaster , which is entirely unrelated to both the story and leary's character , or the numerous anecdotal sequences ? ) , but the central plot itself is a serpentine mess , filled with crosses and double crosses and triple crosses . . .",negative

890,"unfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship .",negative
891,"at this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days .",negative

1161,"i'm a huge john woo fan , but he paints his films with suspense , skill , style , depth , characterization , and just plain cool violence .",negative
1162,"in the films of seagal , the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly , and him either wounding or killing them .",negative
1163,"at some points , they use the cliche of the talking villain , where the villain has the advantage , can shoot seagal , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan , or saying a corny line , to which seagal says something hokey back , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them , and does .",negative
1164,"this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn't take itself seriously at all , like in the case of this summer's "" con air . """,negative

1166,i wouldn't mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence .,negative

1168,"the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish , thus we can't take him and his motives seriously , and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment , he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig , and kills some workers who were just doing his job .",negative
1169,"then at the end , he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech , just in case you didn't get the message from the trailers .",negative
1170,"what seagal doesn't realize is that no one takes his films seriously ( although maybe a couple do ) and any message he has is no only redundant , but doesn't comfortably fit in his film , which is filled to the brim with hokey violence , crap suspense , stupid melodrama , and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish .",negative

1182,"and also , look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey's assasins .",negative

1201,well as i said there are a few amusing moments .,negative
1202,"surprisingly , julie brown , who i usually find just plain goofy , was the best thing in the film .",negative

1205,not much to say about the film really .,negative
1206,it is just kind of there .,negative

1372,"the trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist .",negative
1373,"you will get 90-plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less .",negative

1379,"indeed , sherry appears to be on her way , but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming .",negative
1380,that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows .,negative
1381,big momma's house's bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs .,negative
1382,"doubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there's just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character's attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman .",negative
1383,"unfortunately , big momma's house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters .",negative
1384,"suspension of disbelief in big momma's house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other .",negative
1385,"of course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma's house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny .",negative
1386,"and it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul-tempered beast , while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry .",negative
1387,"unfortunately , no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another , very different real person , so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags : malcolm reacting violently to big momma's explosive diarrhea attack ; malcolm-as-momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) .",negative
1388,"martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there's no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character .",negative

1391,"there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) .",negative
1392,"i'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way .",negative

1397,"starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role .",negative
1398,"not that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation .",negative
1399,"and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence .",negative

1401,william baldwin isn't a bad actor .,negative
1402,"unfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie .",negative

1404,"if it was the latter , it worked .",negative
1405,cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie .,negative

1414,"anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin .",negative
1415,"who's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films ) .",negative
1416,"the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud .",negative
1417,the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes .,negative
1418,"if i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears .",negative
1419,"as for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability .",negative
1420,"unfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad .",negative
1421,"this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks .",negative
1422,"it's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much .",negative

1430,"however , throughout this simple plot , we've got to suffer outlandish special effects , poor comedy , and an very , very mean performance from bill murray .",negative
1431,"frank cross isn't 'funny' mean , he's just mean .",negative
1432,"he also isn't very good at emotional scenes , and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film , with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is , and how he has changed .",negative
1433,"however , the supporting cast are ok , with good performances from mitchum , allen ( who plays his girlfriend ) and john glover ( who plays cross's 'partner' ) the ghost of christmas past isn't that bad either .",negative
1434,"sadly , though , the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of 'home alone' style violence from the ghost of christmas present , played by carol kane .",negative
1435,"whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny , should be fired straight away .",negative

1438,the script is horrendous .,negative
1439,"michael o'donaghue churns out terrible , bad taste jokes ( which i guess is the whole point really ) then changes direction completely to emotional scenes .",negative
1440,"and he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes , which are awful .",negative
1441,"the special effects look nice , but do nothing for the film .",negative
1442,there's some impressive make up effects also .,negative
1443,"the music is also good , which is scored by danny elfman .",negative
1444,but great effects and make up don't make a great film .,negative
1445,"scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience , seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway , and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech .",negative
1446,"why didn't cross just look out his exec window , and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him ?",negative

1451,"not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on ( her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible ) , but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses .",negative
1452,"this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans , but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive , capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles ( though , i admit , it doesn't show in this mess ) .",negative
1453,"henstridge , just like every other actor in the film , delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey .",negative

1461,that's it .,negative
1462,76 minutes never seemed so long .,negative
1463,this is a drawn-out chase scene through dimly-lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie .,negative
1464,the plot development is nil ; we learn absolutely nothing about lambert's character and very little about henstridge's character .,negative
1465,the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the flashlight .,negative

1625,"with an anemic plot and not-quite-kosher special effects , _john carpenter's vampires_ has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan .",negative

1637,"_vampires_ finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix , as crow , guiteau , and montoya assault an abandoned prison-turned vampire nest .",negative

1657,"this kind of humor can only go so far , but certainly can't go the distance in a full-length feature .",negative

1845,"basically the worst thing about this film , the real reason i'm giving this such a low rating , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we'd do .",negative

2062,"though , to be fair , an interesting complete failure .",negative
2063,the idea at the film's core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds .,negative

2715,"for instance , charles kalecki ( alan king ) , a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book , turns into a suave mob boss .",negative
2716,"and , more importantly , hammer's suspicious love interest , charlotte bennett ( barbara carrera ) , morphs from a run-of-the-mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic .",negative
2717,""" i , the jury "" is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane's books ( including a 1953 version which was made in 3-d ) , but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way : it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood's production code .",negative
2718,"although this takes the 1982 version of "" i , the jury "" closer to the core of the original subject matter , it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism , because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book .",negative

2720,"it features one woman having her neck slashed , a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia ( judson scott ) , and another woman shot point-blank in the belly by hammer himself .",negative
2721,"no one would deny that spillane's writing has a definite misogynistic nature , but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment ; its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling .",negative

2725,"cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well , but he was yanked from the director's chair after only a week's worth of shooting because he was already $100 , 000 over budget .",negative

2732,"but the problems in "" i , the jury "" run deeper than the technical .",negative
2733,"the central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties .",negative
2734,"because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer's character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona .",negative
2735,we never really get that impression in the movie -- there is no first-person voice-over narration and some scenes don't have hammer in them at all .,negative
2736,"consequently , a great deal of the texture of spillane's storytelling is lost .",negative
2737,the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer's moral code is thrown to the wind .,negative
2738,"despite his characterization as a hard-nosed , violent , misogynistic killer , hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code .",negative
2739,"the title itself , "" i , the jury , "" refers to his anti-establishment notion of being his own law .",negative
2740,"unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police , hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment .",negative
2741,"in this way , he can be seen as "" above the law , "" but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct , his own morality .",negative
2742,"the movie forgoes that aspect of his character , and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society's terms , but in any terms , especially his own .",negative
2743,"if anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful .",negative
2744,"maybe the scene was intended for laughs , but it only cheapens hammer's character and is , by all accounts , a lousy way to start the movie .",negative
2745,"the blame for hammer's character can't be laid on assante's shoulders , because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon-like mumbling , he delivers a fine performance .",negative
2746,"spillane never once described hammer's physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared , so any actor could conceivably portray him .",negative
2747,"of course , because of the lack of written description , those who have read spillane's books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like , and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( spillane , who played the character himself in 1963's "" the girl hunters , "" is generally considered the best of the film hammers ) .",negative
2748,the rest of actors are most un-noteworthy .,negative
2749,"with the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino , everyone who appeared in "" i , the jury "" were up-and-comers who basically went nowhere .",negative
2750,"many of them ended up working in television ( like carrera , who had a short stint on "" dallas "" in the mid-eighties ) , which only adds to the made-for-tv atmosphere of the film .",negative

2763,just that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat .,negative
2764,the four leads are nearly all playing the same character .,negative
2765,"only williams stands out ( while still performing on the level of his humor-free comedy rocket man ) , but that is because he's imprisoned throughout most of the film , giving a much needed change of pace ( but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another ) .",negative

2771,"granted , it's pretty much a one-joke role , and there aren't a ton of laughs . . . but this film needs every one it can scrape up .",negative
2772,"to top it off , and in a move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film , thurgood is given a love interest , mary jane ( rachel true ) .",negative
2773,her role is that of the public service announcement : to inform us why doing drugs ( including pot ) is wrong .,negative

2810,"anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon's fact based novel the king and i , and it's big , expensive and soulless .",negative
2811,"though good-looking , its lavish sets , fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson's script .",negative
2812,so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting .,negative
2813,this is jodie foster's first movie since the jaw-droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn't the best choice to show off her acting chops .,negative
2814,"she's trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens , the uptight , widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam ( now thailand ) with her son to instruct the king's ( chow yun-fat ) son in the ways of the west ( because "" the ways of england are the ways of the world ) .",negative
2815,"the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family ( 58 kids with 10 more in the way ; impressive , no ? ) .",negative
2816,"the eldest prince is none too happy about this ( "" father , have i offended you in some way ?",negative
2817,"why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher ? ) , but soon gets to know anna and her stern- mother-who-loves-you personality better and comes to like her .",negative
2818,"meanwhile , siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma .",negative
2819,"the king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain's doing which arouses suspicion in siam , putting anna in an uncomfortable position .",negative
2820,she is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king's prejudices .,negative
2821,"he , though self-righteous as ever , can't help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly , quietly , develop affections for each other .",negative
2822,there is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king's younger daughters dies .,negative
2823,"it's your classic deathbed scene , with the girl's mournful eyes staring at her father , who tries only semi- successfully to maintain his composure .",negative
2824,anna then comes in and cries a bit .,negative
2825,the sequence was there for a purpose : to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer .,negative
2826,"i'm usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time , i was just sitting there , my emotions untouched .",negative
2827,this remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren .,negative
2828,we never develop connections to the characters ; never given a reason to care .,negative
2829,"this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant , whose last film was ever after , one of my favorites of 1998 .",negative
2830,"i do not doubt tennant's ability to put together a decent movie , but anna and the king , aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient .",negative
2831,"the sets and scenery are gorgeous , but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur .",negative
2832,even terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia .,negative
2833,we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view ; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger-than-life awe .,negative
2834,"i liked both foster and yun-fat , who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles .",negative
2835,"foster's generally stoic persona serves her well here , as she is playing a reserved , formal and rather underdeveloped character .",negative
2836,"yun-fat is especially effective , perfectly conveying the king of siam's sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts .",negative
2837,what does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations .,negative
2838,"the cast is great , the director is talented , and the budget is lavish , but this ill-advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole .",negative
2839,this is an emotionless costume epic .,negative
2840,robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein .,negative
2841,"mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit .",negative
2842,"unfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world .",negative
2843,"it is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce .",negative
2844,"the plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves .",negative
2845,"this is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie .",negative
2846,"mel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on .",negative
2847,the movie's scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice .,negative
2848,"cary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard .",negative
2849,"he escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis .",negative
2850,"he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil "" sheriff of rottingham "" .",negative
2851,a good adventure plot that is sadly unused .,negative
2852,"elwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating .",negative
2853,"neither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren't funny , nor believable .",negative
2854,perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone .,negative
2855,"this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre .",negative
2856,"much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre .",negative
2857,"chuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from "" rent-a-wreck "" ) then from any dialogue whatsoever .",negative
2858,"scenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting .",negative
2859,perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive .,negative
2860,"the basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny .",negative
2861,"mel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) .",negative
2862,the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails .,negative
2863,"the addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive .",negative
2864,the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard .,negative
2865,"he is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting .",negative
2866,"if you can't , don't even bother watching this miserable film .",negative
2867,"with his successful books and movies , michael crichton is doing well .",negative
2868,"with early successes with westworld ( 1973 ) and coma ( 1978 ) , and recent films such as jurassic park ( 1993 ) , his films have been entertaining .",negative
2869,"however , he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere .",negative
2870,"this $100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull , long winded , and a huge disappointment .",negative
2871,"considering the huge budget , the all star cast , and a story by crichton , sphere is majorly disappointing .",negative
2872,"the film opens with norman goodman ( hoffman ) , a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors .",negative
2873,"however , when he arrives , he his told by supervisor barnes ( peter coyote ) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft .",negative
2874,"along with goodman is mathematician harry adams ( jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( stone ) and ted fielding ( liev schrieber . )",negative
2875,"they investigate the spaceship , find a massive sphere inside , meet an alien intelligence called jerry , and basically weird crap happens .",negative
2876,"unfortunately , something went wrong along the way with sphere .",negative
2877,"the film starts off entertaining enough , but throughout this very long movie , it just gets sillier and sillier .",negative
2878,"the film jaunts along from scene to scene , never fully explaining what is going on .",negative
2879,"the actors and directing don't help , either .",negative
2880,"hoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie , churning out dull lines , and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie .",negative
2881,"stone is useless , displaying no emotion , and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman .",negative
2882,"the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson , who's funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere .",negative
2883,"but he's hardly in it , and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone .",negative
2884,"the same goes for peter coyote , who hams it up as the officer , but is then killed off halfway through .",negative
2885,"the director , barry levinson , who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure ( 1994 ) messes up with the drama and the action .",negative
2886,"the drama scenes are , quite frankly , boring , and the action scenes suffer from overkill , with levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful speed 2 , 1997 )",negative
2887,"the writing doesn't help much , either .",negative
2888,"although crichton is great with plots , he's terrible with dialogue , and practically every line in sphere is a dud .",negative
2889,"the speech is too simple , i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent .",negative
2890,practically every line is just stating the obvious .,negative
2891,none of it is smart .,negative
2892,"also , where the hell did the budget go ?",negative
2893,"the sphere itself is impressive , and there's a few nice special effect shots , but where the $100 million went is anyone's guess .",negative
2894,"there's a giant squid attack in the picture , but not once does the audience see the squid , even though the film has a massive budget .",negative
2895,"i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid , and if handled correctly it probably would .",negative
2896,"but the whole scene is done badly , and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid .",negative
2897,"finally , the film has no idea what genre to be .",negative
2898,levison can't handle his own plot .,negative
2899,"it leaps from hokey sci-fi , to horror , and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller .",negative
2900,"and , of course , the film is very much like the abyss ( 1988 ) , although in it's defense , crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released ( and is far superior to this rubbish . )",negative
2901,it's not all that bad though .,negative
2902,"the plot is all right , there's a few jump scenes ( although nothing very scary ) and there's the occasionally interesting bit .",negative
2903,"but overall , sphere is a big waste of some fine talent , a lot of money , and a potentially good movie .",negative
2904,not really worth seeing .,negative
2905,overall rating= review by david wilcock,negative
2906,"director luis mandoki's last film was the superb , serious 1994 drama "" when a man loves a woman , "" but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture , "" message in a bottle , "" which is the worst type of romance , a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up .",negative
2907,"everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before---and much better---so there's an absence of suspense , and the film ultimately moves at such a very , very deliberate pace , as if it is trying to make great , "" meaningful "" statements and plot developments , that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through .",negative
2908,""" message in a bottle "" begins with theresa osborne ( robin wright penn ) , a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune , whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day .",negative
2909,"inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine , and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and , to her objection , finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper .",negative
2910,"soon , a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message , and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake , theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks , a boating town in north carolina , to find out the specifics of the message .",negative
2911,"of course , garrett turns out to be a handsome , rugged man around theresa's age and played by kevin costner .",negative
2912,"she is immediately charmed by him , but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there , and finds that catherine was garrett's late wife who died a few years earlier .",negative
2913,do you think you know where this is headed ?,negative
2914,"most likely you do , and i wouldn't call it giving away anything to say that by the picture's end , the movie has fallen into deep , artificial melodrama that i didn't buy for a second .",negative
2915,"if there are any positive things to say about "" message in a bottle , "" it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett's stubborn , but loving father , are far above par to be in such a wasteful , "" shaggy dog "" love story , and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast , and paints chicago as an equally alluring city .",negative
2916,"meanwhile , costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has made recently .",negative
2917,"it seems that with such bad luck , he wouldn't want to make another movie set near water , but here he is again with one of the main , and most ridiculous , centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea .",negative
2918,"the other actors are all , sadly , wasted , including illeana douglas , an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the "" friend "" roles , here playing penn's confidante and co-worker at the tribune .",negative
2919,"the first half of "" message in a bottle "" plays like a hum-drum , trite television movie for the lifetime channel , as theresa spends a great deal of time "" getting to know "" garrett , with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining .",negative
2920,"usually , i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships , but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt "" written , "" and not as if people were really "" talking . """,negative
2921,"when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other , and are not particularly interesting themselves , you know immediately that you are in trouble .",negative
2922,"i swear that while watching "" message in a bottle , "" i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater ( heck , in actuality i'm not even familiar to the novel this is based on , by nicholas sparks ) .",negative
2923,"always one step ahead of the characters , the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true hollywood melodrama , the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing .",negative
2924,"nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa's secret , and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after .",negative
2925,"this same exact problem occurred in last year's very , very similar ( watch this , and you will realize just how similar i mean ) meg ryan-nicolas cage romantic drama , "" city of angels . """,negative
2926,"although theresa is deeply touched by the "" heartfelt "" letter that she finds in the bottle , perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own , preferably before filming began .",negative
2927,"it should have read , "" memo to screenwriters : use you brain ! """,negative
2928,i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago .,negative
2929,i guess my memory really sucks .,negative
2930,"there is very , very little that is funny in caddyshack .",negative
2931,"the laughs are few , and far between , and what there are really aren't that great .",negative
2932,"caddyshack , as the name implies , more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club .",negative
2933,michael o'keefe plays said caddy .,negative
2934,"why they cast this unknown , fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me .",negative
2935,"the movie doesn't seem to have a real plot , just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera .",negative
2936,"the only real story , if you can call it that , was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper , bill murray , who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course .",negative
2937,most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera -- with painfully limited success .,negative
2938,"bill murray is slightly amusing in places , but fairly wasted .",negative
2939,"the biggest waste of all is chevy chase , who didn't even crack a smile on my face with his character's lame zen-like approach to golfing .",negative
2940,"there are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight , but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie .",negative
2941,i guess that's what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid .,negative
2942,"i'm not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of , but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper .",negative
2943,nothing about this movie works .,negative
2944,it wouldn't have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasn't going to fly .,negative
2945,most of the scenes just couldn't possibly be funny .,negative
2946,it's as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world .,negative
2947,i'm sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny .,negative
2948,"in reality , they were painfully embarrassing to watch .",negative
2949,"there is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the "" hot babe "" of the movie walking by in her bikini .",negative
2950,olive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl .,negative
2951,everything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned .,negative
2952,maybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny .,negative
2953,"but for the rest of us , stay the hell away from caddyshack .",negative
2954,tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse .,negative
2955,the fugitive ?,negative
2956,"not quite ? this is the plot for double jeopardy , another fugitive copycat without the action , excitement , and good acting that the original had .",negative
2957,"there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good ; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall , clever huh ?",negative
2958,oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband ( bruce greenwood ) who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man .,negative
2959,both movies are on video .,negative
2960,make the wise choice and pick the fugitive .,negative
2961,"there are so many flaws in double jeopardy , it is laughable .",negative
2962,"while serving time in prison , libby parsons ( judd ) discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice .",negative
2963,"learning that her husband is still alive , she decides to serve her time in prison , find him , retrieve her son , and kill her husband if necessary .",negative
2964,"when the strict parole officer travis lehman ( jones ) stands in her way , libby decides to break the rules ( who knows why ? ) and continue her plan , despite the fact that if she gets caught , she's going back to jail .",negative
2965,director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son .,negative
2966,"every other scene , we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture .",negative
2967,"in an action movie like this , valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something .",negative
2968,"all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend "" i miss my son . """,negative
2969,"nothing more , nothing less .",negative
2970,"dr . kimble of the fugitive didn't look at one picture of his dead wife , his primary concern was to save himself .",negative
2971,libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough .,negative
2972,"ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this , they will be typecast for the rest of their careers , kind of like their doomed co-star tommy lee jones .",negative
2973,winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilty roles .,negative
2974,people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right .,negative
2975,though i don't think he will win another oscar again .,negative
2976,the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons .,negative
2977,"even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer , the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count .",negative
2978,"burglary , assault , grand theft auto are some of libby's slipups .",negative
2979,the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you're innocent of the major crime .,negative
2980,hopefully criminals won't use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent .,negative

3203,"the animation team does design their share of well animated settings , so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king , until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds .",negative
3204,"i have not read the play , or seen the oscar winning , 1956 film adaption , but from what i can tell , the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play , for the king and i is never magical , nor interesting .",negative
3205,"if it wasn't for miranda richardson , who voices anna with feeling , the king and i could earn the title , "" worst movie of the decade . """,negative
3206,"instead , the king and i will just go down as among the year's worst .",negative
3207,the bottom line- avoid this movie at all costs .,negative
3208,"not even young children , the target audience in this film , will enjoy it .",negative
3209,not the slightest bit .,negative

3211,"reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate .",negative
3212,comments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies .,negative
3213,she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner .,negative
3214,the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title .,negative
3215,"not even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese .",negative
3216,"it's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it's oddly fascinating .",negative
3217,"the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out .",negative
3218,the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel .,negative
3219,"to this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following .",negative
3220,i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother .,negative
3221,"i have never read this book , but i sure hope it's 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation .",negative
3222,"if not , then i'm at a complete loss to explain its popularity .",negative
3223,the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene .,negative
3224,"a young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e . t . ,",negative
3225,tramps about in the woods .,negative
3226,"with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience's expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered .",negative

3231,"a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven .",negative
3232,i won't detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point .,negative
3233,this movie is really stupid .,negative
3234,it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief .,negative
3235,"also , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston .",negative
3236,the movie doesn't just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four .,negative
3237,"a blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs .",negative
3238,"she's of the "" new people "" ; they're of the "" old people "" with "" the memories . """,negative

3240,we get it .,negative
3241,we get it .,negative
3242,"the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me .",negative
3243,"the movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing .",negative
3244,"as stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time .",negative
3245,the rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt .,negative
3246,the face-painting that's occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind .,negative
3247,this movie also suffers from its new age trappings .,negative
3248,"maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music .",negative
3249,"add to this the film's faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you'd expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious .",negative
3250,"the clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it's probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i've seen in quite a while .",negative
3251,it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity .,negative
3252,the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes .,negative
3253,the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear .,negative
3254,the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about .,negative
3255,"although this may sound gratuitous , i'm sure , it's so cheesy that it probably won't bother most people .",negative
3256,the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie .,negative
3257,"however , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality .",negative
3258,"typically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind .",negative
3259,"the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it's so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) .",negative
3260,"i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i'm only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie .",negative
3261,i shudder to think that it could be otherwise . . .,negative
3262,salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets .,negative
3263,"actors who demand such salaries might be greedy , but in some instances they are quite justified , because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation .",negative
3264,"proof for that can be found even in the realm of low-budget movies , and one fine example is breakaway , 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring ( in ) famous figure skater tonya harding .",negative
3265,"face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie's poster , but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra , attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster .",negative
3266,"one day she decides to retire , but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that .",negative
3267,"realising that her life suddenly became worthless , myra starts running for her life , followed by professional assassins .",negative
3268,terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater .,negative
3269,"although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities , her acting leaves much to be desired .",negative
3270,"on the other hand , her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality , believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b-films a bad name .",negative
3271,"martin sheen's brother joe estevez , whose character looks like he had entered from another movies' set , is the only bright spot of breakaway .",negative
3272,"unfortunately , he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding's silver screen debut proved to be her last film .",negative
3273,"movies like six days , seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford , anne heche , and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents . ?",negative
3274,"the script was written by michael browning , and he decided that , instead of thinking up new ideas , he'd rehash a lot of cliches , omit even the slightest bit of character development , and then throw in drug-dealing pirates to provide for a few high-level action sequences and explosions . ?",negative
3275,"there are good scripts out there that high-profile actors can make ( see the truman show , for instance ) . ?",negative
3276,"six days , seven nights is simply a waste .",negative

3278,.,negative
3279,.,negative
3280,we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island . ?,negative
3281,"so , how do we do that ? ?",negative

3284,"but wait , if she has a fianc ? e , how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone ? ?",negative
3285,i know ! ?,negative
3286,"they'll get to their vacation spot , and then she'll get called back ! ?",negative
3287,yessssss ! ?,negative
3288,"so , they'll crash on the island , and that will be funny for about five minutes . ?",negative
3289,shucks .,negative
3290,"oh , i've got it ! ?",negative
3291,"we'll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc ? e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo , and then he can feel guilty . ?",negative
3292,"then , when anne heche kisses harrison ford ( they have to kiss , because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie ) , it will be a vindicated action , because her fianc ? e will already have cheated on her ! ?",negative
3293,"then , for no obvious reason , they'll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them . ?",negative
3294,"oh , yes ! ?",negative
3295,i feel so good about this story . ?,negative
3296,"instead of using characterization to propel the events , it will be completely random , and yet totally predictable ! ?",negative
3297,imagine that .,negative
3298,"don't get me wrong -- six days , seven nights is not a boring picture ; ford and heche both do a great job . ?",negative
3299,"the sparks fly between them , and so most of browning's inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors' sheer force of talent .",negative
3300,"? almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen , and i found myself laughing pretty hard . ?",negative
3301,"schwimmer is also funny , and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get . ?",negative
3302,"and reitman , who has made some good films , at least tries to make things exciting . ?",negative
3303,"even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb , i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences .",negative
3304,it's just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces . ?,negative
3305,the picture feels like it's been hacked to pieces -- i wouldn't be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely . ?,negative
3306,"the ones that are here are as bad as they come ( i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships ) , and i'd just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream , "" why did you pick this awful script ! ? "" ?",negative
3307,"the film is outright stupid , but some of the elements are subtly horrifying . ?",negative
3308,"for instance , take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo , and then feels really guilty . ?",negative
3309,"this is a serious problem in real life , but six days , seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device : ? his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford . ?",negative
3310,"in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety , i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story .",negative
3311,"this is summer movie season , but that doesn't mean our movies have to be dumb . ?",negative
3312,1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters . ?,negative
3313,"when i was in line for six days , seven nights , i heard the woman in front of me ask for "" two tickets to that new harrison ford movie . """,negative
3314,? why didn't she know the name of the film ? ?,negative
3315,i suppose she just didn't care .,negative
3316,? what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big-budget pictures don't realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves . ?,negative
3317,"good actors should sign to good scripts , and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash , they least they could do is assume that we'd like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents .",negative
3318,"if anything , "" stigmata "" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another .",negative
3319,"of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst .",negative
3320,i suppose i should have seen this coming .,negative
3321,"after all , "" blair witch "" thoroughly creeped me out , "" sixth sense "" was mildly spooky , and then "" stir of echoes "" had its moments , but wasn't anything i'd lose sleep over .",negative
3322,"clearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping .",negative
3323,"is it then any surprise that "" stigmata "" is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ?",negative
3324,"no , not really .",negative
3325,"patricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother .",negative
3326,"as it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest .",negative
3327,the priest's church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue .,negative
3328,"father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue .",negative
3329,"his investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ .",negative
3330,"father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie' s story , considering she's an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on .",negative
3331,"he eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church .",negative
3332,"as it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a "" fifth gospel "" before they were excommunicated .",negative
3333,the new rupert wainwright music video .,negative
3334,.,negative
3335,.,negative
3336,"i mean film "" stigmata "" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse .",negative
3337,"indeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it's only interesting for about five minutes .",negative
3338,"i'm not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school .",negative
3339,"his camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing .",negative
3340,"what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , "" see ?",negative
3341,look at what i can do !,negative
3342,"i'm an ex-cellent dir-ect-or . """,negative
3343,"maybe then he'd explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) .",negative
3344,"if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn't see it .",negative
3345,"just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever .",negative
3346,arrrrrrrghhhh .,negative
3347,.,negative
3348,.,negative
3349,"then again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn't bother me if "" stigmata "" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging .",negative
3350,"though wainwright's vanity certainly doesn't help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script .",negative
3351,where are plot continuity and character development when you need them ?,negative
3352,"case in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren't given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her .",negative
3353,"the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she's kind of cute , so let's start the bleeding !",negative
3354,"the fact that she's clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn't help , either .",negative
3355,"according to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ?",negative
3356,go clubbing !,negative
3357,"sure , that makes sense .",negative
3358,"arquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking .",negative
3359,"scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable .",negative
3360,"even though frankie page's life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon .",negative
3361,"even more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances .",negative
3362,father andrew's religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic .,negative
3363,"as for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , "" i'll get you , my pretty , "" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded .",negative
3364,"trust me , i'm not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain .",negative
3365,"what's worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible .",negative
3366,"first of all , the film doesn't even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ?",negative
3367,"how come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ?",negative
3368,"actually , i'm not sure what frankie was posessed by .",negative
3369,"supposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) .",negative
3370,which one is it ?,negative
3371,"the answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time .",negative
3372,"furthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church .",negative
3373,"if you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you'll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library .",negative
3374,"there's nothing the catholics need to worry about , though .",negative
3375,""" stigmata's "" religion is so off-base that it can't be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church .",negative
3376,"if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting .",negative
3377,"i'm not catholic ; in fact , i don 't care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means .",negative
3378,"it's rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as "" stigmata "" does .",negative
3379,"it' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be .",negative
3380,"i'm not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story .",negative
3381,maybe it's an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever .,negative
3382,"the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over .",negative
3383,"like so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill .",negative
3384,"so much is overdone in "" stigmata , "" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film's ( many ) flaws .",negative
3385,i'm also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering .,negative
3386,"when we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing .",negative
3387,"the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and "" stigmata "" is it .",negative
3388,"john boorman's "" zardoz "" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own .",negative
3389,not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time .,negative
3390,"of course , wood's career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent .",negative
3391,"boorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain "" zardoz "" ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful "" exorcist ii : the heretic "" ) .",negative
3392,"boorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn't know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent .",negative
3393,"this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece "" deliverance "" ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama "" hope and glory "" ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic "" excalibur "" ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure "" the emerald forest "" ( 1985 ) .",negative

3396,"unfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around .",negative
3397,""" zardoz "" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman's .",negative
3398,"his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even "" the wizard of oz , "" a book which figures into the movie's plot .",negative
3399,"but , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling .",negative
3400,"the events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found .",negative
3401,"in fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions .",negative

3418,"it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn't get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming .",negative

3435,"as it is , their first--and most likely only--attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv .",negative

3447,"strangely , the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv .",negative
3448,the movie makes several attempts at risqueness--mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters--but they seem almost forced ; as if they have to live up to a pg rating .,negative

3468,"the non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed , without any interesting camera work , which is usually a trademark of carpenter's .",negative
3469,"and then we come to the screenplay , which , as far as i can tell , is nearly non-existent .",negative
3470,"there is no story development , and there isn't even an attempt to flesh out the characters .",negative
3471,"james woods can be a good actor , but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of "" pseudo "" -clever lines of dialogue .",negative
3472,"daniel baldwin has some potential , but his character comes off as being very dense .",negative

3487,"that little fact has been used as justification for the film's existence , that the butabis' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters .",negative

3497,"granted , a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film's best joke is completely dependent on one's familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_'s lack of inspiration .",negative
3498,that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves .,negative
3499,"like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ , "" the roxbury guys "" is a one-joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context .",negative

3503,"films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before .",positive
3504,"for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .",positive
3505,to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .,positive
3506,"the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .",positive
3507,"in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source .",positive
3508,"if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes .",positive
3509,"getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?",positive
3510,"the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end .",positive
3511,"it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .",positive

3515,"i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .",positive
3516,"in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .",positive
3517,"it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .",positive
3518,"and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" ) .",positive
3519,don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it .,positive
3520,"now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .",positive
3521,"the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic .",positive
3522,oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .,positive

3536,"the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be .",positive
3537,"you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have .",positive
3538,"_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype .",positive
3539,"what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier .",positive

3552,what happened ?,positive
3553,"how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ?",positive
3554,"even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy .",positive
3555,"broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then .",positive
3556,witherspoon is a revelation .,positive
3557,"it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination .",positive
3558,"and once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over .",positive
3559,one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it .,positive
3560,there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film .,positive
3561,"i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . .",positive
3562,"but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom .",positive
3563,"as the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story .",positive
3564,"it is bad enough that mr . m doesn't like tracy's determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ?",positive
3565,"even so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does .",positive
3566,"there's a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment .",positive
3567,you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to .,positive
3568,"in order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits .",positive
3569,"no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) .",positive
3570,"essentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking .",positive
3571,"it's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative .",positive
3572,"but oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is .",positive
3573,"but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle .",positive

3580,"little do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person's true identity .",positive
3581,the rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen .,positive
3582,"sure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship .",positive
3583,"all of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax .",positive
3584,"but as foreseeable as the ending is , it's so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does .",positive

3590,"from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly .",positive
3591,"right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once "" jaws "" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip .",positive
3592,"perhaps what is most outstanding about "" jaws "" is how spielberg builds the movie .",positive
3593,"he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act .",positive
3594,"unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act .",positive
3595,"until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music .",positive
3596,"he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying .",positive
3597,he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery .,positive
3598,"the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years .",positive
3599,"the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money .",positive
3600,"brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute .",positive
3601,"hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( "" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine "" ) make it that much more terrifying .",positive
3602,"when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark .",positive

3604,""" jaws "" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror .",positive
3605,"it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by "" star wars "" ) .",positive
3606,"even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's "" psycho , "" and it never seems to age .",positive
3607,"although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill .",positive
3608,"the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects .",positive
3609,"scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time "" jaws "" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman .",positive
3610,"nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark .",positive

3613,"dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in "" american graffiti "" ( 1973 ) and "" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz "" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers .",positive
3614,"however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards .",positive
3615,"bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism .",positive
3616,"he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature .",positive
3617,"however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars .",positive
3618,quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s .,positive

3620,"his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen .",positive
3621,"shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film .",positive
3622,"of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature .",positive
3623,"a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in "" jaws , "" and they are a threat .",positive
3624,"every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into .",positive
3625,"the shark in "" jaws "" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed "" bruce "" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles .",positive
3626,"many have forgotten , but "" jaws "" was a sort of precursor to "" waterworld "" ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb .",positive

3630,"in the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him .",positive
3631,"in the movies , you end up with films like "" spawn "" , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors .",positive
3632,jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking .,positive
3633,he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line .,positive
3634,"watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages .",positive
3635,"but like the lions star , jackie doesn't have anybody to block for him .",positive
3636,"almost every cent that's invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills .",positive
3637,"this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence .",positive
3638,this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain .,positive
3639,"( chan's first release in this country , "" rumble in the bronx "" , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . )",positive
3640,"heck , jackie doesn't even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist .",positive
3641,"in condor , chan plays the same character he's always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu .",positive
3642,"jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) .",positive
3643,"he is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , "" jackie , save us ! "" , and misuse firearms .",positive
3644,"the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he's more pathetic than evil .",positive
3645,"en route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives .",positive
3646,"once at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film's centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that's even better than the one in face/off .",positive
3647,"this is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions .",positive
3648,"ignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain's legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn't he take the key with him ? ) .",positive
3649,"don't worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara .",positive
3650,just go see the movie .,positive
3651,"operation condor has pretentions of being a "" raiders of the lost ark "" knockoff , but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a+ movie .",positive
3652,"however , you've got to go with what you've got , and what you've got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize .",positive
3653,"on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo .",positive
3654,"two months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides .",positive
3655,"this little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in "" lumumba . """,positive
3656,"patrice lumumba's ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , "" lumumba - death of a prophet , "" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject .",positive
3657,"peck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader .",positive
3658,we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men .,positive
3659,"images of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image .",positive
3660,jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo .,positive
3661,"a third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader .",positive
3662,"his small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville .",positive
3663,"at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc .",positive
3664,"as the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) .",positive
3665,"the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more .",positive
3666,"lumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government .",positive
3667,his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination .,positive
3668,"the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad .",positive
3669,this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries .,positive
3670,"peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50's and 60's .",positive
3671,"( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them .",positive
3672,some colonial masters were better than others . ),positive
3673,"the effort involved in "" lumumba "" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all .",positive
3674,"production values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget .",positive
3675,the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique .,positive
3676,the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman's work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba's life .,positive
3677,"the political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches .",positive
3678,"it concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn't embellish on a larger than life persona .",positive
3679,"the family side of patrice's life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child .",positive
3680,"i know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba .",positive
3681,"the story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it .",positive
3682,high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character .,positive
3683,"the actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions .",positive
3684,"in true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead .",positive
3685,""" lumumba "" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both .",positive
3686,it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i've seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ .,positive
3687,"apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether .",positive
3688,"i've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce .",positive
3689,"as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton .",positive
3690,"it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star .",positive
3691,"norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year .",positive
3692,"he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) .",positive
3693,"the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car .",positive
3694,"we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny .",positive
3695,"in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother .",positive
3696,"much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy .",positive
3697,"when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things .",positive
3698,"what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms .",positive
3699,"it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material .",positive
3700,"because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic .",positive
3701,"i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart .",positive
3702,the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men .,positive
3703,"it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up .",positive
3704,"of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part .",positive
3705,it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest .,positive
3706,"in addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease .",positive
3707,"even when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead .",positive
3708,what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny .,positive
3709,"the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien .",positive
3710,"visually , the film is very powerful .",positive
3711,"kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere .",positive
3712,"but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes .",positive
3713,"although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed .",positive
3714,"for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way .",positive
3715,"it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film .",positive
3716,perhaps this last scene was the problem .,positive
3717,"it's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way .",positive
3718,one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding .,positive
3719,and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it .,positive
3720,"her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 .",positive
3721,"but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film .",positive
3722,"and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life .",positive
3723,"written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor .",positive
3724,alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare .,positive
3725,"as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting .",positive
3726,"walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob .",positive
3727,ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain .,positive
3728,"she looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits .",positive
3729,"she's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown .",positive
3730,"and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance .",positive
3731,"thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters .",positive
3732,"the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family .",positive
3733,"ringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister .",positive
3734,"walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious .",positive
3735,"when the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , "" money versus values . """,positive
3736,"ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises .",positive
3737,sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body .,positive
3738,"it's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight .",positive
3739,"lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry .",positive
3740,lapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot .,positive
3741,"and what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure .",positive
3742,"lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off .",positive
3743,"i don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed .",positive
3744,"the scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia .",positive
3745,"joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) .",positive
3746,"alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet .",positive
3747,"the film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it .",positive
3748,"as a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful .",positive
3749,"and while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy .",positive
3750,"after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians , who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo .",positive
3751,"their officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique , the congo's army , caused rebellions , undermining lumumba , who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals .",positive
3752,"with unrest building , moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country's resources , proclaimed secession .",positive
3753,"lumumba replaced janssens , making mobutu a colonel , and went on a pacification",positive
3754,"tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) , but it was too late .",positive
3755,"'when you want to drown a dog , you say it has rabies , ' prophesies lumumba of his own fate .",positive
3756,"peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players , although they frequently succumb to cliche , particularly regarding lumumba's private life .",positive
3757,"peck's script illuminates bantu sayings like 'the hand that gives , rules' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador .",positive
3758,"peck's direction is less assured , with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare .",positive
3759,"he's served well , though , by his casting of ebouaney in the title role .",positive
3760,"ebouaney is dynamic , radiating his character's fierce passion for his people and his country .",positive
3761,"lumumba's intelligence and ability to strategize , even as he's cornered by insurmountable odds , are given life by ebouaney .",positive
3762,peck's subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production .,positive
3763,""" lumumba "" is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney's performance makes the tragedy personally felt .",positive
3764,the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats .,positive
3765,"it's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea .",positive
3766,"sometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other .",positive
3767,"quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem .",positive
3768,"but too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors .",positive
3769,flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists .,positive
3770,mostly it's laughable .,positive
3771,"in hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form .",positive
3772,"but iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right .",positive
3773,"iron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry .",positive
3774,"but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) .",positive
3775,"unlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression .",positive
3776,"iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth .",positive
3777,"iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger .",positive
3778,"however , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox .",positive
3779,"in those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience .",positive
3780,"while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune .",positive

3831,"nicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life .",positive
3832,"meg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we're fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive .",positive
3833,"after losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient's transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor .",positive
3834,"he begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday .",positive
3835,"angels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire .",positive
3836,"seth's adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community .",positive
3837,"the angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it's a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness .",positive
3838,"cage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once .",positive
3839,it's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire .,positive
3840,"the two aren't very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual "" intelligently ditzy "" romantic comedy roles , and it's an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy .",positive
3841,"but even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye .",positive
3842,"it's a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn't know quite how to get to it .",positive
3843,they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high .,positive
3844,"filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths .",positive
3845,"based on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending .",positive
3846,"most movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized .",positive
3847,"nonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories .",positive
3848,synopsis : bobby garfield ( yelchin ) lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother ( hope davis ) .,positive

3853,"review : a small but enchanting movie , "" hearts in atlantis "" easily recalls another king-inspired coming-of-age film , "" stand by me "" , both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys .",positive
3854,""" hearts "" is a tribute to the magic of childhood , to those summers when the days seem neverending , and nothing means more than your closest friends .",positive
3855,"unlike "" stand by me "" , there is a supernatural element to "" hearts "" , but although it is key to the plot , it is not prominent .",positive
3856,"like "" stand by me "" , this is a mostly character-driven film , and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting .",positive
3857,"yelchin is very good as bobby , finding a good mix of innocence and resignation .",positive
3858,"more splendid still is boorem , whom i praised highly for her work in "" along came a spider "" and who is simply radiant here as carol .",positive
3859,"and then there is hopkins , who despite playing such a quiet , introspective character as ted , nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen .",positive
3860,"less successful is davis , whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish .",positive
3861,"i also found it odd that bobby and carol's other friend , sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movie's flashback framing device ) , is paid virtually no attention .",positive
3862,"but hicks' direction is lovely without being cloying , and despite the movie's general lack of incident , it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience .",positive
3863,"synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners .",positive
3864,"cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves .",positive
3865,"technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave .",positive
3866,"lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men .",positive
3867,"three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery .",positive
3868,a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters .,positive
3869,opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life .,positive
3870,"in fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion .",positive
3871,"real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved .",positive
3872,spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story .,positive
3873,djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances .,positive
3874,the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do .,positive
3875,"lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice .",positive
3876,"the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower .",positive
3877,"most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants .",positive
3878,it takes a pretty smart person to do that .,positive
3879,but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ?,positive
3880,what if he's also able to think on his feet ?,positive
3881,"in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ?",positive
3882,it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator .,positive
3883,"in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force .",positive
3884,"when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder .",positive
3885,"faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office .",positive
3886,"i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but . . . "" ,",positive
3887,although it wouldn't surprise me if he did .,positive
3888,"luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above .",positive
3889,"after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t .",positive
3890,"walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed .",positive
3891,"although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue .",positive
3892,"jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman .",positive
3893,"the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats .",positive
3894,the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence .,positive
3895,"how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ?",positive
3896,"unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability .",positive
3897,"almost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back .",positive
3898,"when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course .",positive
3899,his is an interesting character .,positive
3900,"made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation .",positive
3901,""" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , "" he says .",positive
3902,"when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be .",positive
3903,"soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail .",positive
3904,this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor .,positive
3905,"as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely .",positive
3906,gray really lucked out with this cast .,positive
3907,"david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey .",positive
3908,"the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a .",positive
3909,"in l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land .",positive
3910,"with the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven .",positive
3911,"also in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides .",positive
3912,"his character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything .",positive
3913,"fortunately , this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout .",positive
3914,"j . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances .",positive
3915,"sadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film .",positive
3916,"walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon .",positive
3917,"for one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton .",positive
3918,"when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) .",positive
3919,"the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing .",positive
3920,"in the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality .",positive
3921,we're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best .,positive
3922,"as an audience , we're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we'd like to see if one will dominate the film .",positive
3923,both provide some pretty good entertainment .,positive
3924,"plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he's devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place .",positive
3925,critique : i'm a sucker for movies like this .,positive
3926,"a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time .",positive
3927,"in the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer .",positive
3928,"his entry and adaptation to the whole "" rock 'n roll "" lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch .",positive
3929,although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it .,positive
3930,"metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn't that prominent anymore , i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again .",positive
3931,"that's not to say that you won't like this film if you don't like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all .",positive
3932,but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg .,positive
3933,"wow , hand this fella some major props , as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally , metal god was the film's original title , and a much better one if you ask me ) .",positive
3934,he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through .,positive
3935,"he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic , who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams .",positive
3936,"aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet ) , but she didn't pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes .",positive
3937,"i was also impressed by some of the "" real "" musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) , but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members .",positive
3938,"it's to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) .",positive
3939,"just for the record , i'm certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements , since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies , but because it's a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances .",positive
3940,"oh yeah , and for those who dig the "" heavier "" side of music , the soundtrack also rocks ! !",positive
3941,you see . . . dreams,positive
3942,can come true . . .,positive
3943,where's joblo coming from ?,positive
3944,almost famous ( 8/10 ) - blow ( 8/10 ) - boogie nights ( 9/10 ) - detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) - girlfight ( 6/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 ),positive
3945,carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion .,positive
3946,"made in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre .",positive
3947,"sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode .",positive
3948,"the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard .",positive
3949,"this time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode .",positive
3950,"the doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - "" i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other ! """,positive
3951,bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself .,positive
3952,"there are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he's at work ( at the railway station ) .",positive
3953,sid james' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home .,positive
3954,he has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him !,positive
3955,the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital's pills with panic ensuing .,positive
3956,"there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous 'matron's' .",positive
3957,"williams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james isn't given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all .",positive
3958,"the same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time , he seems to steal every scene he is in .",positive
3959,"by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor's talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it's good storyline and it's other appealing characters .",positive
3960,this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored !,positive
3961,"the ultimate match up between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry .",positive
3962,"based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script .",positive
3963,the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public .,positive
3964,elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order .,positive
3965,"however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws .",positive
3966,the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes .,positive
3967,"the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws .",positive
3968,the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl .,positive
3969,"from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard .",positive
3970,"right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs .",positive
3971,"this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced .",positive
3972,i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone .,positive
3973,the film only gets better from this point .,positive
3974,"with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats .",positive
3975,they walk in unison and they only look forward .,positive
3976,as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens .,positive
3977,"holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films .",positive
3978,"one that comes to mind is "" the matrix "" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world .",positive
3979,"wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless .",positive
3980,""" the untouchables "" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film .",positive
3981,the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army .,positive
3982,each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others .,positive
3983,"elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film .",positive
3984,he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be .,positive
3985,"however , as the film develops so does ness .",positive
3986,his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side .,positive
3987,he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends .,positive
3988,his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in .,positive
3989,"sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables .",positive
3990,malone acts as a mentor to ness .,positive
3991,"he teaches him "" the chicago way "" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun .",positive
3992,connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed .,positive
3993,"andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer .",positive
3994,"as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him .",positive
3995,charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone .,positive
3996,smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film .,positive
3997,the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen .,positive
3998,"also very similar to "" the matrix , "" they are exciting and intense .",positive
3999,">from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed .",positive
4000,the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement .,positive
4001,its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors .,positive
4002,the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective .,positive
4003,"although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action .",positive
4004,"some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid .",positive
4005,"having not seen , "" who framed roger rabbit "" in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently .",positive
4006,watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is .,positive
4007,"aside from the fact that it's a milestone in animation in movies ( it's the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it's also quite an effective comedy/mystery .",positive
4008,"while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun .",positive
4009,the story begins in hollywood in 1947 .,positive

4012,"maroon thinks that roger's wife , jessica's , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots .",positive
4013,"valiant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon .",positive
4014,"upon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect .",positive
4015,the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger's good name .,positive

4017,`who framed roger rabbit' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) .,positive
4018,"director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators .",positive
4019,also bob hoskins' performance should be credited .,positive
4020,"he , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars .",positive
4021,"according to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off .",positive
4022,`who framed roger rabbit' is a rare film .,positive
4023,one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) .,positive

4033,""" permanent midnight "" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit .",positive
4034,"a habit , in stahl's own words , "" the size of utah . """,positive
4035,"as stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance .",positive
4036,"unlike "" trainspotting , "" which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , "" permanent midnight "" instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance .",positive
4037,"one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to "" naked lunch "" author william s . burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , "" so i can shave . """,positive
4038,"stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in "" permanent midnight "" ; it's so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills .",positive
4039,"while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl's autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed .",positive
4040,""" permanent midnight "" shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author's words-- "" escape the drug scene "" ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you'd swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings .",positive

4042,"janeane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith , and that's stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor .",positive

4046,"gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million .",positive

4048,"minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone .",positive
4049,"the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you've already seen , and it was nothing more than that .",positive

4053,"instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . """,positive
4054,"at this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts .",positive
4055,the last half of the film is very well done .,positive
4056,"another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie .",positive
4057,"owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : "" it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . """,positive

4063,one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction .,positive
4064,"the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun .",positive
4065,sometimes the stories are compelling .,positive
4066,sometimes they're not .,positive
4067,"but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions .",positive
4068,star trek : insurrection is no exception .,positive
4069,"the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why .",positive
4070,"it's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film .",positive
4071,"some say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film .",positive
4072,others say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring .,positive
4073,i simply enjoyed the film .,positive
4074,"insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet .",positive
4075,"of course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f .",positive

4077,"the son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying .",positive
4078,that's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) .,positive
4079,"so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat .",positive
4080,"when dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode .",positive
4081,"this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it .",positive
4082,"insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters .",positive
4083,"stewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together .",positive
4084,"jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy .",positive
4085,"frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action .",positive
4086,"this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look .",positive
4087,"if i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so .",positive
4088,i don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands .,positive
4089,"better yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ?",positive
4090,insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience .,positive

4095,"1996's the cable guy was supposed to be his big "" breakthrough "" role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting .",positive
4096,"as most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar .",positive
4097,"not only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics .",positive
4098,"as far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it .",positive
4099,"the first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn't really like it .",positive
4100,"however , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i've had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film .",positive
4101,"and to my surprise , it grew on me .",positive
4102,"the plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship .",positive
4103,"see , steven's been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn't think he has any more room in his life for a new friend .",positive
4104,"also , some of the cable guy's antics have been creeping him out .",positive
4105,"carrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn't enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done .",positive
4106,"for me , its not the movie as a whole that's enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven's apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few .",positive
4107,perhaps the fact that more of carrey's humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny .,positive
4108,"and if you really want to see something , you've got to hear his version of jefferson airplane's "" somebody to love "" , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam .",positive
4109,"the cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie .",positive
4110,"i didn't particularly like steven's girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend .",positive
4111,"also , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing .",positive
4112,"still , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you're at the video store and can't think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out .",positive
4113,"or if you have hbo , just wait till it comes on ( you won't have to wait long . )",positive
4114,"hell , that's what i do every day .",positive
4115,"when bulworth ended , i allowed myself a sigh of relief : ? it is possible for me to enjoy political satire . ?",positive
4116,"there have been several recent political films that didn't do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog , for instance , i found to be an intelligent but heartless film , while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness . ?",positive
4117,"bulworth is a far better film than these , both in its execution and lasting impression . ?",positive
4118,"it's a tremendously funny and intelligent picture , but it also has an emotional center -- writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character , and , in turn , we like him and actually care about the story .",positive
4119,?,positive
4120,beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth ; the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again . ?,positive
4121,"he hasn't slept in days , nor has he eaten , and , almost instantaneously , he goes insane .",positive
4122,"? he's not stark raving mad ( not outright , anyway ) , but he's definitely bonkers .",positive
4123,"? it's the final weekend of his campaign , and his assistant , murphy ( oliver platt ) has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto .",positive
4124,"? bulworth begins the speech , but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest . ?",positive
4125,""" you mean , "" one lady asks , "" the democratic party doesn't care about the african american community ? "" ?",positive
4126,""" well , "" he shouts , laughing , "" isn't that obvious ? """,positive
4127,the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that it's a bad thing to make decisions when you're suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman .,positive
4128,? bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated .,positive
4129,"? suddenly , in the short span of this weekend , bulworth's no-nonsense "" truth in politics "" methods become a national sensation , and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he's appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences .",positive
4130,beatty's work on both sides of the camera is excellent . ?,positive
4131,"his script and direction are both extremely sharp , as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself . ?",positive
4132,"here is a man who's reached his limit , and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure . ?",positive
4133,"i like that the film doesn't take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations , but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) . ?",positive
4134,"some of the segments are simply hilarious , such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him . ?",positive
4135,"much of the film is completely absurd , but that's the fun part about it . ?",positive
4136,"it's an angry , serious film at the core , but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre . ?",positive
4137,what adds to this feeling is beatty's portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale .,positive
4138,"? beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he's always funny , but he's also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions .",positive
4139,"? beatty is so good that bulworth , despite his shortcomings as a human being , is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning .",positive
4140,the supporting cast is vast and colorful . ?,positive
4141,"berry is luminous , as always , and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles . ?",positive
4142,don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work . ?,positive
4143,"oliver platt is an actor who should be careful , for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though he's very funny to watch ) . ? paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections .",positive
4144,is bulworth offensive ? ?,positive
4145,i suppose some may see it that way . ?,positive
4146,"i wasn't offended by the film , but then again , i hardly care about politics . ?",positive
4147,i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story . ?,positive
4148,"the film isn't perfect , of course -- the ending didn't quite work for me , and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) . ?",positive
4149,but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film . ?,positive
4150,"bulworth is a smart , uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface . ?",positive
4151,"call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul .",positive
4152,"the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman .",positive
4153,"you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings .",positive
4154,"we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes .",positive
4155,"in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry .",positive
4156,"shakur and roth play ezekiel "" spoon "" whitmore and alexander "" stretch "" rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) .",positive
4157,"when a new year's eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time .",positive
4158,"they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done .",positive
4159,"as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape .",positive
4160,"the government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) .",positive
4161,"in order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year's day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all .",positive
4162,"gridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991's falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles .",positive
4163,"in falling down , michael douglas' d-fens ( the character's personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock'd by the drug lord d-reper's plates ) whips out a gun because he can't get breakfast at mcdonald's ; in gridlock'd , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center .",positive
4164,"and where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation .",positive
4165,"one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , "" do you expect the world to stop . . . just",positive
4166,"because you picked _today_ to clean up ? """,positive
4167,"the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time .",positive
4168,"hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them .",positive
4169,"a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments .",positive
4170,"in one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures .",positive
4171,"the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time .",positive
4172,"hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior .",positive
4173,"oh , the irony of it .",positive
4174,"tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up .",positive
4175,"in gridlock'd , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him .",positive
4176,"spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction .",positive
4177,"mostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta .",positive
4178,"it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch's pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon's goal as any agency or enemy .",positive
4179,"gridlock'd's most cruelly comic scene finds stretch "" helping "" spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him .",positive
4180,"with friends like that , spoon doesn't need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much .",positive
4181,the tragedy now is that we won't get more chances to see those eyes again .,positive

4243,"and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , "" finally , a decent sound system ! """,positive
4244,"you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street .",positive

4247,"and while the lyrics to "" wild thing "" may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love .",positive
4248,"even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats .",positive
4249,"the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal .",positive
4250,"all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time .",positive
4251,"in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time .",positive
4252,"for a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating .",positive
4253,"all in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us .",positive
4254,"the variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in .",positive
4255,"if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled .",positive
4256,it's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore .,positive
4257,"instead we're stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling .",positive
4258,"the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages .",positive
4259,"martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime .",positive
4260,"unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies .",positive
4261,seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime .,positive
4262,"this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s .",positive
4263,"goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) .",positive
4264,"the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york .",positive
4265,"at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands .",positive
4266,"after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) .",positive
4267,"three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history .",positive
4268,"wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business .",positive
4269,"but the perfect world of "" wiseguys "" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends .",positive
4270,goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory .,positive
4271,scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker .,positive
4272,world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating .,positive
4273,"scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny .",positive
4274,"after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens .",positive
4275,"scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience .",positive
4276,"with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era .",positive
4277,"even if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker .",positive
4278,"first , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue .",positive
4279,"then , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards .",positive
4280,"this multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation .",positive
4281,same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack .,positive
4282,"nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s .",positive
4283,"but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed .",positive
4284,"however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people .",positive
4285,"such scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s .",positive
4286,"fragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese .",positive
4287,"he uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious "" a day in life "" segment near the end of the film .",positive
4288,another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents .,positive
4289,"the most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues .",positive
4290,"joe pesci deserved his "" oscar "" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film .",positive
4291,"ray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film .",positive
4292,liotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs .,positive
4293,"liotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction .",positive
4294,"lorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband .",positive
4295,"paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave .",positive
4296,"as a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time .",positive
4297,"because of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s .",positive
4298,""" the blair witch project "" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses .",positive
4299,"its success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted .",positive
4300,"after the release of "" the blair witch project "" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch .",positive
4301,"locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , "" get out of these woods and go home !",positive
4302,"there is no goddamned blair witch ! "" .",positive
4303,"jeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage .",positive
4304,"after he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet .",positive
4305,"as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the "" blair witch hunt "" .",positive
4306,"among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called "" the blair witch : history or hysteria ? "" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers .",positive
4307,"the last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying "" the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold . """,positive
4308,"this strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience .",positive
4309,"on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr's abandoned house , strange things start happening .",positive
4310,when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain .,positive
4311,after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies .,positive
4312,"they are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth .",positive
4313,they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality .,positive
4314,the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods . .,positive
4315,"documentary director joe berlinger ( "" paradice lost "" ) helms "" blair witch 2 "" , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background .",positive
4316,"the opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand .",positive
4317,"but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue .",positive
4318,"in a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel .",positive
4319,more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail .,positive
4320,the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated .,positive
4321,"of course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values .",positive
4322,"from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell's ( "" being john malkovich "" and "" fargo "" ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with "" the blair witch project "" .",positive
4323,""" blair witch . . """,positive
4324,was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation .,positive
4325,"in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere .",positive
4326,"with its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment .",positive
4327,"and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor .",positive
4328,the key is simplicity .,positive
4329,""" blair witch project "" had a story which was incredibly simple .",positive
4330,that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination .,positive
4331,"the film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares .",positive
4332,"the effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way .",positive
4333,""" book of shadows "" feels incredibly controlled and restrict .",positive
4334,"here , very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and "" clever "" that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it .",positive
4335,there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with .,positive
4336,this is simply a less artistic film that doesn't have the talent and originality of its predecessor .,positive
4337,it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn't always succeed .,positive
4338,"but most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie , which doesn't allow it to destroy the original .",positive
4339,"in the end , i can't call it a bad effort .",positive
4340,"it's less artistic , not so scary and less original , but certainly not bad .",positive
4341,it's simply different .,positive
4342,"in fact , if you haven't seen "" the blair witch project "" , you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between "" the blair witch project "" and the "" scream "" -films .",positive
4343,the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism .,positive
4344,"but it's a common knowledge and experience that , with a few exceptions , every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making .",positive
4345,"to me the story of "" the blair witch project "" seemed completed , but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that "" the book of shadows "" is certainly assured .",positive
4346,"and it's already time to look forward to "" blair witch 3 "" .",positive
4347,"seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) .",positive
4348,"one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise .",positive
4349,"with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie .",positive
4350,"there's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there .",positive
4351,the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict .,positive
4352,"the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist .",positive
4353,"we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely .",positive
4354,"later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right .",positive
4355,"the fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling .",positive
4356,"this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone .",positive
4357,the man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him .,positive
4358,"in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while .",positive
4359,"but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story .",positive
4360,"eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police .",positive
4361,"we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time .",positive
4362,"two other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies .",positive
4363,it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film .,positive
4364,"he also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story .",positive
4365,"but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo .",positive
4366,"everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities .",positive
4367,"however , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential .",positive
4368,"by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax .",positive
4369,everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction .,positive
4370,"but , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . '",positive
4371,"for reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) .",positive
4372,"the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight .",positive
4373,"at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then .",positive
4374,this premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard .,positive
4375,he does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form .,positive
4376,the aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not .,positive
4377,"in the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world .",positive
4378,"however , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is .",positive
4379,"the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) .",positive
4380,"for example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending .",positive
4381,"and that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense .",positive
4382,"ironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world .",positive
4383,with `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message .,positive
4384,"still , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable .",positive
4385,"there's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does .",positive
4386,the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years .,positive
4387,`dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world .,positive
4388,"linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable .",positive
4389,"she's still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith .",positive
4390,"one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom .",positive
4391,"he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it .",positive
4392,"god would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again .",positive
4393,"bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the "" prophets "" jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith's films thus far .",positive
4394,"at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) "" thirteenth apostle "" , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) .",positive
4395,it's a wild ride .,positive
4396,"they're in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return .",positive
4397,loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates .,positive
4398,"at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets .",positive
4399,"it's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , "" how corrupt are you ? "" .",positive
4400,wings of desire this ain't .,positive
4401,"since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors .",positive
4402,"( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden . )",positive
4403,"his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another .",positive
4404,"dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition .",positive
4405,"as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever .",positive
4406,"any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack .",positive
4407,"a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough .",positive
4408,"because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time .",positive
4409,"sure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated .",positive
4410,"like tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker .",positive
4411,"dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes !",positive
4412,"smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan "" catholicism wow ! "" ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished .",positive
4413,i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions .,positive
4414,proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever .,positive
4415,"it's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma .",positive
4416,"the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy .",positive
4417,"there's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against .",positive
4418,( not one of them had watched it . ),positive
4419,every single person refused .,positive
4420,"smith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith .",positive
4421,"in fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster .",positive
4422,( i felt sentimental about a religion i don't belong to .,positive
4423,"now that's powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through .",positive

4425,my religion is movies .,positive
4426,"when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they're attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid .",positive

4428,you've heard all the hype .,positive
4429,"you've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker .",positive
4430,"if you've read any reviews , you've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy .",positive
4431,"you also may have heard that this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults .",positive
4432,believe the hype .,positive
4433,"the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth .",positive
4434,"but there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy .",positive
4435,the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters .,positive
4436,"the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence .",positive
4437,"he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out .",positive
4438,portman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well .,positive
4439,"amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) .",positive
4440,"and obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman .",positive
4441,"however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job .",positive
4442,"he also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise .",positive
4443,"in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film .",positive
4444,"i would never call myself a "" star wars "" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america .",positive
4445,"however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost .",positive
4446,"for example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine .",positive
4447,"for those of you not recently steeped in "" star wars "" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in "" return of the jedi "" and "" empire strikes back . """,positive
4448,"so , obviously , his appearance in "" phantom menace "" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful .",positive
4449,a lot of the movie is like that .,positive
4450,"r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them . . .",positive
4451,because he doesn't do much to add to it in any way .,positive
4452,"same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy .",positive
4453,"even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from "" empire strikes back "" ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in "" star wars "" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing .",positive
4454,what's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ?,positive
4455,the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty .,positive
4456,"there's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be .",positive
4457,another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film .,positive
4458,"i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters .",positive
4459,"and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast .",positive
4460,"unlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive "" teenage mutant ninja turtles . """,positive
4461,"furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot .",positive
4462,"oddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids .",positive
4463,"well , he's done a good job .",positive
4464,"the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy .",positive
4465,"that's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him .",positive
4466,"that's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader .",positive
4467,warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! !,positive
4468,"in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film .",positive
4469,"the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie .",positive
4470,"he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine .",positive
4471,but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn't all hearts and roses is yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn .,positive
4472,his explanation ?,positive
4473,""" his future is clouded . """,positive
4474,( warning : major spoiler ahead .,positive
4475,enter at your own risk . ),positive
4476,"of course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side .",positive
4477,"this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup .",positive
4478,"because qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself .",positive
4479,"so , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin "" darth vader "" skywalker .",positive
4480,did this story need to be told ?,positive
4481,i would say no .,positive
4482,but is it a worthwhile movie to see ?,positive
4483,absolutely .,positive
4484,"if you don't enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie .",positive
4485,the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation .,positive
4486,the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight .,positive
4487,"and yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time .",positive
4488,"above all , this is a fun movie .",positive
4489,"not deep , not meaningful , and not profound .",positive
4490,but fun .,positive
4491,"maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed "" empire "" will direct .",positive
4492,"because if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential .",positive
4493,: ),positive
4494,"as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film .",positive
4495,the shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars .,positive
4496,"to see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film .",positive
4497,"as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin .",positive
4498,"the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous .",positive
4499,this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds .,positive
4500,it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film .,positive
4501,""" in the heat of the night "" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america .",positive
4502,jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental .,positive
4503,in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers .,positive
4504,he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present .,positive
4505,"preceding the very original "" a soldier's story "" and the recently released "" the hurricane , "" "" in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters .",positive
4506,"the film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted .",positive
4507,tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him .,positive
4508,"as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist .",positive
4509,"poitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character .",positive
4510,"never nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing .",positive
4511,"however , unlike "" the hurricane "" where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance .",positive
4512,"as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role .",positive
4513,he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople .,positive
4514,"he would refer to tibbs as "" boy "" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him .",positive
4515,"as the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff .",positive
4516,he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors .,positive
4517,what i really enjoyed about steiger's character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film .,positive
4518,he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil .,positive
4519,"instead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future .",positive
4520,most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes .,positive
4521,this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day .,positive
4522,jewison's determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate .,positive
4523,""" in the heat of the night "" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960's .",positive
4524,it displays this perfectly .,positive
4525,"however , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest .",positive
4526,it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim .,positive
4527,there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) .,positive
4528,"also , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered .",positive
4529,the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic .,positive
4530,( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson .,positive
4531,"he managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , "" in the heat of the night "" and the even better "" in cold blood . "" )",positive
4532,in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance .,positive
4533,"ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's .",positive
4534,"in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world .",positive
4535,"you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open .",positive
4536,"in wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful .",positive
4537,"he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes .",positive
4538,grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map .,positive
4539,"when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms .",positive
4540,"grady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy .",positive
4541,"their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for .",positive
4542,leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions .,positive
4543,he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges .,positive
4544,"he's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated .",positive
4545,"he reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) .",positive
4546,"whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white .",positive
4547,"leer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth .",positive
4548,tobey maguire fits well in the role .,positive
4549,"with his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude .",positive
4550,"but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility .",positive
4551,"katie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants .",positive
4552,this is a plot line i had trouble with .,positive
4553,"douglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions .",positive
4554,"at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it's because i'm jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas's real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones .",positive
4555,seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping .,positive
4556,suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i'm pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas .,positive
4557,there is a movie in there somewhere .,positive
4558,"grady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor .",positive
4559,"okay , maybe not so chivalrous .",positive
4560,"there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , "" she was a junkie for the printed word .",positive
4561,"lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice "" .",positive
4562,robert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm .,positive
4563,downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual .,positive
4564,he's arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance .,positive
4565,"the actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor .",positive
4566,i wish wonder boys had more of him .,positive
4567,"searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that's part of its charm .",positive
4568,"and maybe i'm a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i'm greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema .",positive
4569,"everyone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to .",positive
4570,i'm privy to films about literary types i . e .,positive
4571,"those individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch .",positive
4572,"the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points .",positive
4573,"sometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that's a problem i wish i found with films more often .",positive
4574,"another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up .",positive
4575,"for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags .",positive
4576,"the gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do .",positive
4577,"the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn't ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things .",positive
4578,"curtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films .",positive
4579,"he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up .",positive
4580,"the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits .",positive
4581,the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen .,positive
4582,"it's the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies .",positive
4583,"many will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties .",positive
4584,plot : derek zoolander is a male model .,positive
4585,he is also very dumb and impressionable .,positive
4586,"for that reason , he is secretly hired and trained ( so secret , that even he doesn't know about it ) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , who wants to abolish child labor in his country .",positive
4587,will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed ?,positive
4588,"will zoolander ever grace the world his new "" look "" ?",positive
4589,is this a funny movie ?,positive
4590,find out below . . .,positive
4591,"critique : there's a place in our world for "" stupid comedies "" .",positive
4592,"films which don't pretend to take themselves seriously , are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes .",positive
4593,"there's also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history , might be an ideal circumstance during which to "" relax "" by watching something so completely frivolous .",positive
4594,"well , if you're in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment , ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time .",positive
4595,"of course , comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny , while others will grant them the "" stupid "" , but consider it funny instead .",positive
4596,"i personally enjoyed it for the most part , cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry .",positive
4597,snap !,positive
4598,"it was also nice to see several real-life models with small roles in the movie , not taking themselves too seriously .",positive
4599,"and if you're the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films , well , don't look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn , billy zane , winona ryder , christian slater , david duchovny , natalie portman and many , many others .",positive
4600,i especially liked andy dick's complete make-over as the masseuse .,positive
4601,hi-larious !,positive
4602,"but with all films of this type , there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn't work .",positive
4603,"a few particulars which didn't strike my fancy included the bulimia and "" orgy "" sequence with christine taylor , the break-dance fighting , and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this ( why not just "" make up "" a country , instead of zeroing in on a certain people ? ) .",positive
4604,"i also could have done with less of the taylor character in general , since she wasn't all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then ( more zoolander , dude ! ) .",positive
4605,but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me !,positive
4606,"i almost pissed myself during the "" gas station "" disaster , absolutely adored the "" walk-off "" contest ( with david bowie as the judge , no less ) and appreciated many of zoolander's moronic one-liners ( "" i was a merman . . . a",positive
4607,"merman ! ! "" ) .",positive
4608,"and i dare you to get his "" monkey "" photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie ( "" you're a monkey , derek . . . a",positive
4609,"monkey ! "" )",positive
4610,"i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film , both of which zipped and zagged , and established a nice rhythm to it all .",positive
4611,"again , it's to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone , but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer , you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well .",positive
4612,"if you thought the trailer was dumb , skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something , a film from which there is an obvious influence here .",positive
4613,"blue steel , baby . . . yeah ! ! !",positive
4614,where's joblo coming from ?,positive
4615,"austin powers ( 7/10 ) - austin powers 2 ( 7/10 ) - deuce bigalow ( 7/10 ) - dude , where's my car ( 7/10 ) - freddy got fingered ( 5/10 ) - jay & silent bob strike back ( 8/10 ) - joe dirt ( 5/10 ) - meet the parents ( 8/10 ) - say it isn't so ( 3/10 )",positive
4616,"unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric .",positive
4617,"ostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning .",positive
4618,"many scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room .",positive
4619,"the cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) .",positive
4620,"director douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he "" couldn't care less about the truth "" but was more interested in capturing "" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . """,positive
4621,"despite violating nearly every rule of "" legitimate "" documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment .",positive
4622,"while it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi .",positive
4623,"this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable .",positive
4624,"he has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( "" it's about women not wanting to look like cows "" ) to mary tyler moore ( "" between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country "" ) to style ( "" it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs "" ) .",positive
4625,unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress .,positive
4626,it's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine .,positive
4627,"the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection .",positive
4628,"in particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista .",positive
4629,"on the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped .",positive
4630,"a variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color .",positive
4631,"there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences .",positive
4632,"nevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment .",positive
4633,"while unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear .",positive
4634,"overall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed .",positive
4635,"when the designer declares that "" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , "" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed .",positive
4636,dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station .,positive
4637,"she , in her colorful demeanor , offers a service that is unheard of in the states .",positive
4638,"she writes letters for the illiterate , who pass through , to try to find lost relatives , find love , or search after lost debts .",positive
4639,"she+s quirky , she+s elderly , she+s caring .",positive
4640,"totally trustworthy , right ?",positive
4641,not a chance .,positive
4642,"once home , she never sends these letters , saving money on postage , and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra ) .",positive
4643,"one of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son , looking for their father .",positive
4644,"shortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus , and the son is orphaned .",positive
4645,"days go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament .",positive
4646,"through a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon , dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father .",positive
4647,"this means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace .",positive
4648,films like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films .,positive
4649,"it is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world , so distant from my own .",positive
4650,"it does so entertainingly , and so heart-wrenchingly .",positive
4651,"and yet , it+s backdrop is merely that .",positive
4652,"the focus is on the minute transformation of dora , of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental .",positive
4653,the most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film .,positive
4654,"dora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals .",positive

4662,people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it .,positive
4663,i don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused .,positive
4664,it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history .,positive
4665,"anyone who tells you "" it's just a movie "" is either lying or clueless .",positive
4666,it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic .,positive
4667,the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated .,positive
4668,but that does not mean that the film itself is bad .,positive
4669,"in fact , it is terrific .",positive
4670,i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash .,positive
4671,it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place .,positive
4672,"the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo .",positive
4673,"the republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as "" the force "" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate .",positive
4674,"unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene .",positive
4675,"on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie's real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) .",positive
4676,"he is an innocent slave boy , but "" the force is strong with him "" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi .",positive
4677,"as any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker .",positive
4678,>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie .,positive
4679,"around 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul .",positive
4680,"i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this .",positive
4681,"this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks .",positive
4682,"he's essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like "" exqueeze me ? """,positive
4683,"and "" mesa go now , okeday ? "" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying .",positive
4684,the visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph .,positive
4685,if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement .,positive
4686,"the climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn't already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term "" popcorn movie "" .",positive
4687,what made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams .,positive
4688,"even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant .",positive
4689,his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling .,positive
4690,the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia .,positive
4691,"when you see "" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away "" , when the familiar music plays , when the words "" star wars "" appear on screen , you'll feel a tingle even if you didn't see the movie when it first came out in '77 .",positive
4692,"it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side .",positive
4693,"it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not .",positive
4694,"we not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years .",positive
4695,"the phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars .",positive
4696,"it works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia .",positive

4701,a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings .,positive
4702,"definitely a generation-x aimed movie , a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke-based musical dream sequence .",positive
4703,whew !,positive
4704,anyone in their 30's or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film .,positive
4705,"it's somewhat silly , it's somewhat outrageous , and it's definitely not your typical romance story , but for the right audience , it works .",positive
4706,a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting .,positive
4707,"well sorry folks , but i haven't seen trainspotting so i can't really compare .",positive
4708,whether that works in this film's favor or not is beyond me .,positive
4709,"but i do know this : ewan mcgregor , whom i had never had the pleasure of watching , definitely charmed me .",positive
4710,he was great !,positive
4711,cameron diaz's character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp .,positive

4718,this was just one more thing i didn't know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke .,positive
4719,"maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise , but i think even if i had known , i would have been just as happy .",positive
4720,"a life less ordinary is quirky , eccentric , and downright charming !",positive
4721,"not for everyone , but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies .",positive
4722,that thing you do !,positive
4723,"( r ) tom hanks's screenwriting and directorial debut , that thing you do ! , has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh-so-nice .",positive
4724,"it is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this '60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast .",positive
4725,"that thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , "" that thing you do ! """,positive
4726,"the group's members are , naturally a diverse group : there's brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl-crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film's center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz .",positive
4727,"along for the wonders' ride to success is jimmy's perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) .",positive
4728,"hanks proves to be a capable writer-director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls "" the last innocent year . """,positive
4729,"the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes--but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it's still playing in my mind as i write this ) .",positive
4730,"it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film's biggest and best dramatic moment .",positive
4731,"the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early '60s ; they do not appear to be '90s grungers playacting "" retro . """,positive
4732,"yet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! , it's nearly nice to a fault .",positive
4733,"while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days , there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting .",positive
4734,"everyone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all--except toward the end , but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness , ending on an appropriately feel-good note .",positive
4735,there isn't much of an edge throughout that thing--the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks's turn as the wonders' manager--and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it's bland .,positive
4736,"but a little niceness goes a long way these days , and there's no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do ! ; it's just about impossible to hate .",positive
4737,"it's an inoffensive , enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming , if not singing , "" that thing you do ! "" --quite",positive
4738,possibly for days .,positive
4739,"to paraphrase a passage from the song : though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play "" that thing you do ! """,positive
4740,""" he's back , and it's about time . """,positive
4741,"was the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot , i don't care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who , that spawned no series , which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know ) .",positive
4742,the motto was well chosen .,positive
4743,"the series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts .",positive
4744,"as good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who .",positive
4745,is it the acting ?,positive
4746,"hell , no !",positive
4747,"paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who've played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene ) .",positive
4748,"he looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would .",positive
4749,"daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr . grace holloway , the doctor's first companion that he kisses on screen , she is not your typical female companion who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor , she is a tough , spunky american , and ashbrook shows this well .",positive
4750,"young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee , and i've seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included ) , which , imho , wastes his talent .",positive
4751,the only problem with the acting is eric roberts .,positive
4752,"one time he had to say to mcgann's doctor , "" i always dress for the occasion . """,positive
4753,"but he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , "" i always . . .",positive
4754,dress . . .,positive
4755,"for the occasion . """,positive
4756,"you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who's also british , like mcgann is as the doctor .",positive
4757,executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role .,positive
4758,"i dunno who thought of casting him , but if they're reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star !",positive
4759,"he rides on his sister's coattails , and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him .",positive
4760,is this problem the kisses to the past ?,positive
4761,"they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them , only whovians would , and they're good .",positive
4762,is it the script or the movie as a whole ?,positive
4763,"the script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue , and the movie as a whole is one fans will love , and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series .",positive
4764,so what is it ?,positive
4765,simple : no plot .,positive
4766,"the master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him .",positive
4767,"the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey , but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 , where the master , with young street hood chang lee's help , opens the eye of harmony , which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr . grace holloway , doesn't close it by then .",positive
4768,virtually no plot .,positive
4769,"i was told the movie would've featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks , but a lot of rewriting went on on the set .",positive

4783,"she carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings .",positive
4784,but inside she is desperate .,positive
4785,"unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family .",positive

4787,"a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction .",positive
4788,this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple .,positive
4789,not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her .,positive
4790,some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters .,positive
4791,"most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts .",positive
4792,"she has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one .",positive
4793,colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man .,positive

4797,"alan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series "" cybil "" and creator of the new sitcom "" oh grow up "" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years .",positive
4798,not one character in this film rings falsely .,positive
4799,"and the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful .",positive
4800,"the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as "" the graduate "" or "" lolita "" .",positive
4801,kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances .,positive
4802,his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age .,positive
4803,"finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth .",positive

4806,annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career .,positive
4807,carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy .,positive
4808,"unable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder .",positive
4809,ms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone .,positive

4836,this is no formula movie .,positive

4862,"but unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions .",positive
4863,"like a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride .",positive
4864,"like the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach .",positive
4865,robin williams is excellent in this role .,positive
4866,"he's not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth .",positive
4867,"in this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes .",positive
4868,williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling .,positive
4869,i have compared will to a foster child and that's not entirely fair .,positive
4870,"emotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child .",positive
4871,he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants .,positive
4872,"sean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow , but he didn't start out asking for , or particularly needing , help .",positive
4873,"his exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction .",positive
4874,if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama .,positive
4875,"it's too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama , but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama .",positive
4876,"it is emotionally engaging , but it's not quite larger than life .",positive
4877,"this isn't a problem per se , but at times i didn't know quite how to take it .",positive
4878,but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie .,positive
4879,a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow .,positive
4880,"it doesn't just happen ; it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction .",positive
4881,good will hunting has all three .,positive
4882,"if you are at all inclined to see it , by all means , go .",positive
4883,"if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more .",positive
4884,"although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater .",positive
4885,"so when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes .",positive
4886,"although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie .",positive

4888,"the story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema .",positive
4889,"not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough .",positive
4890,kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture .,positive
4891,"it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named "" pleasantville . """,positive
4892,"maguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times .",positive
4893,"it's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like .",positive
4894,"soon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness .",positive
4895,at one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t .,positive
4896,walsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town .,positive
4897,fine performances are turned in all around .,positive
4898,"maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t .",positive
4899,walsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) .,positive
4900,"daniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman's envy .",positive
4901,"for daniels , it's his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career .",positive
4902,"also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish .",positive
4903,"there's not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don't .",positive

4917,"actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones , but was committed to his hit tv show , "" magnum p . i . "" .",positive
4918,"in filming the well of souls sequence , the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on .",positive
4919,hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas .,positive
4920,"however , once all the snakes were on set , it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them , so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths , and these were used as well .",positive

4933,"as legend has it , actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time , and asked if the scene could be shortened .",positive

4942,"capone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him .",positive
4943,"when he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) .",positive
4944,"capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him .",positive
4945,"torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again .",positive
4946,"directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while .",positive
4947,"shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are .",positive
4948,"the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) .",positive
4949,"the make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team .",positive
4950,"the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest .",positive
4951,"paul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times .",positive
4952,"mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together .",positive
4953,"unfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed .",positive
4954,"the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) .",positive
4955,"the end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review .",positive
4956,"oddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us .",positive
4957,"at the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) .",positive
4958,"palm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters .",positive
4959,"chris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record .",positive
4960,"overall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong .",positive
4961,"if action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film .",positive
4962,the performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight .,positive
4963,"i'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved .",positive
4964,"at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds .",positive
4965,that's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) .,positive
4966,"but home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way .",positive

4971,"he attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him .",positive
4972,"the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle .",positive
4973,the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin .,positive
4974,"nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back .",positive
4975,the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night .,positive
4976,"on his way up the stairs , he tells her that "" families suck "" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again .",positive
4977,"that night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport .",positive
4978,"in a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him .",positive
4979,"it's interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children .",positive
4980,"first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class .",positive
4981,they're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child .,positive
4982,"meanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true .",positive
4983,he's finally rid of his family !,positive
4984,life is a dream come true .,positive
4985,"he can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother's secret box .",positive
4986,"slowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane .",positive
4987,"he grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( "" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener "" ) .",positive
4988,"he also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring .",positive
4989,"the furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house .",positive
4990,macaulay culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor .,positive
4991,"still , we can see that kevin's character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing .",positive
4992,"for example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as "" santa "" is getting in his car .",positive
4993,kevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa .,positive
4994,he learned how to deal with the furnace .,positive
4995,you turn on the lights and it's not so scary anymore .,positive
4996,"he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man .",positive
4997,they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid .,positive
4998,"finally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) .",positive
4999,"this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert .",positive
5000,"it's a lot of fun , and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie .",positive
5001,"on the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie .",positive
5002,"john williams' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings .",positive
5003,but it does have its flaws .,positive
5004,the smallest problem is that culkin doesn't act very well .,positive
5005,"as i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin's insight into his character .",positive
5006,"the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin's life about five times .",positive
5007,"instead of "" i'm gonna get that kid "" they say "" i'm gonna kill that kid . """,positive
5008,"some might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree .",positive
5009,mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas .,positive
5010,"i'll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year .",positive
5011,"don't let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick .",positive

5014,to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis .,positive
5015,he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town .,positive
5016,we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them .,positive
5017,quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee .,positive
5018,the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely .,positive
5019,"unlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh .",positive
5020,the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story .,positive
5021,"the performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master .",positive
5022,"so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours .",positive
5023,"longer , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers]",positive
5024,"the primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell .",positive
5025,too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh .,positive
5026,"you watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you .",positive
5027,matinee is not like that .,positive
5028,i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis .,positive
5029,i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film .,positive
5030,"but most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters .",positive
5031,"the comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west .",positive
5032,i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today .,positive
5033,he is highly expressive both physically and vocally .,positive
5034,i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink .,positive
5035,"the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film .",positive
5036,"the movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end .",positive
5037,i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic .,positive
5038,"they tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world .",positive
5039,"unfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time .",positive
5040,"while the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap .",positive
5041,several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light .,positive
5042,one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store .,positive
5043,"if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here .",positive
5044,another reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies .,positive
5045,one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space .,positive
5046,"( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . )",positive
5047,while mant !,positive
5048,"never got made , many films like it were , and mant !",positive
5049,serves mostly as dante's homage to the b-films he loves .,positive
5050,"so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story .",positive
5051,"this isn't a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way .",positive
5052,enjoy !,positive
5053,"when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image .",positive

5056,cool .,positive
5057,"_october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky .",positive
5058,"was it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ?",positive
5059,"have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ?",positive
5060,"it sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal .",positive
5061,"determined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them .",positive
5062,it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket .,positive
5063,"when lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win .",positive
5064,but the joy in a film like this is in the little details .,positive
5065,"for example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class .",positive
5066,"if he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer .",positive
5067,"it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does .",positive
5068,"it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again .",positive
5069,"homer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ .",positive
5070,"here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions .",positive
5071,this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is .,positive
5072,"he is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams .",positive
5073,"but he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how .",positive
5074,through coal-mining .,positive
5075,"because of his character , we can see how far we+ve come .",positive
5076,the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us .,positive
5077,we don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family .,positive
5078,"the paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet , and he knew of no other life .",positive
5079,"so _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought .",positive
5080,and this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you .,positive
5081,"btw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background .",positive
5082,"another commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago .",positive
5083,warning : contains what the matrix is .,positive

5087,i'll tell you i was .,positive
5088,i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen .,positive
5089,"now wait wait , i know most of you loved it , and i'm not saying i didn't like it .",positive
5090,what i'm saying is the first half was extremely slow .,positive
5091,now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show .,positive
5092,"don't be fooled , this movie has a big story .",positive
5093,and big chunks of talky moments .,positive
5094,"but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par , deserving the rating above .",positive
5095,ok now to the story .,positive
5096,well this may take a while .,positive
5097,"ok first of all , our world we live in now , is not the real world , actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix .",positive
5098,"a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out , when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world .",positive
5099,"he does so , and finds out that he can do anything , be anything he wants to be .",positive

5101,"laurence fishburne , his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves .",positive
5102,but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were .,positive
5103,yeah there were some in the first half but not enough .,positive
5104,the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie .,positive
5105,"now for the second half , it is explosive , and saves the movie .",positive
5106,some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking .,positive
5107,"the sound , the music , and all the effects were effective , and the last hour kept us entertained .",positive
5108,"but with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes , this movie is at least 40 minutes too long .",positive

5138,"every year , hollywood crowns a new "" it boy "" --a young actor pegged for major movie stardom .",positive
5139,"inheriting the mantle from last year's "" winner , "" matthew mcconaughey , is matt damon , and , like mcconaughey , he proves to be more than just a fresh young face , as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grisham's the rainmaker and good will hunting .",positive
5140,"damon has his first major starring role , a la mcconaughey , in a john grisham adaptation--in this case , francis ford coppola's take on the rainmaker .",positive
5141,"damon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor , who , immediately after passing the bar exam , finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company .",positive
5142,"while rudy's ( and the film's ) main concern is this case , he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue , in a mercifully brief role ) .",positive
5143,"written for the screen and directed by coppola , the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously .",positive
5144,"coppola's most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself , which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudy's unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance company's hotshot attorney ) .",positive
5145,"the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous , but danes is as superb as always .",positive
5146,"then , of course , there is damon , who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case , the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudy's often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat .",positive
5147,"as good as he is in the rainmaker , damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting , directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself .",positive
5148,"damon plays the title character , will hunting , a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius .",positive
5149,"in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction , an mit math professor ( stellan skarsgard ) taps his old college friend , community college psychologist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , to counsel the abrasive , standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life .",positive
5150,"good will hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests , but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon's intelligent script touches .",positive
5151,"even though no one ( and , if so , _very_ few people ) can directly relate to will's burden of superhuman intelligence , the insecurities he suffers are universal .",positive
5152,the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors .,positive
5153,"williams delivers a nice dramatic turn ; affleck , a hot up-and-coming actor himself ( chasing amy ) , turns up in a warm and charming performance as will's best friend ; and the ever-appealing minnie driver shines as will's harvard-schooled love interest .",positive
5154,"the clear standout in the cast , though , is damon , who bravely does not soften will's prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care for him .",positive
5155,"so many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine , but based on his impressive work in john grisham's the rainmaker and especially good will hunting , it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come .",positive
5156,synopsis : leonard shelby ( pearce ) is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife .,positive
5157,"leonard has only a few clues to the murderer's identity ; to make matters worse , he suffers from a condition which inhibits the creation of short-term memories , meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier .",positive

5159,""" memento "" traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination .",positive
5160,"review : "" memento "" is the sort of movie i wish i'd written ; i can think of no higher praise than that .",positive
5161,"i am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant , involved , original movie as this .",positive
5162,"an instant film noir classic , "" memento "" is virtually flawless .",positive
5163,the script is unlike any i have ever seen -- a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity .,positive
5164,"although the idea of starting at the "" conclusion "" of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the "" start "" is not entirely new , never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence .",positive
5165,""" memento "" is endlessly exciting and inventive , a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself , and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre .",positive
5166,and it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality ; there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively .,positive
5167,"nolan's direction is equally effective , never losing its crispness and clarity despite "" memento "" 's challenging gimmick .",positive
5168,"and to top everything off , all the performances rise to the occasion .",positive
5169,pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard ; moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie ; and pantoliano's teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality .,positive
5170,""" memento "" may be the year's best screenplay , and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001 .",positive
5171,"earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent .",positive
5172,"people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee .",positive
5173,"the story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves .",positive
5174,"the action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta .",positive
5175,shanta has a small circle of male admirers .,positive
5176,"two of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim .",positive
5177,"the others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das .",positive
5178,"( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water . )",positive
5179,"in an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears .",positive
5180,"one of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along .",positive
5181,"he is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism .",positive
5182,the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses .,positive
5183,"it is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter .",positive
5184,"the group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together .",positive
5185,"but the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state .",positive
5186,"a sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees .",positive
5187,another man is murdered .,positive
5188,the group of friends will not meet again .,positive
5189,"the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles .",positive
5190,it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully .,positive
5191,the crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz .,positive
5192,"his sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim .",positive
5193,"dil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him .",positive
5194,"but she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer .",positive
5195,"the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate .",positive
5196,"despite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things .",positive
5197,the conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt .,positive
5198,the story earth tells does not end .,positive
5199,it just stops .,positive
5200,"it is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction .",positive
5201,"but there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades .",positive
5202,"since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus .",positive
5203,"there is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) .",positive
5204,"earth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie .",positive
5205,"it does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas .",positive
5206,"but deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep .",positive
5207,earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history .,positive
5208,"such films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed .",positive
5209,"they may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack .",positive
5210,"it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve .",positive
5211,the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year .,positive
5212,"in the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other .",positive
5213,"at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ; after seeing earth , i have a much , much better understanding .",positive
5214,"up until about a year ago , john travolta's career consisted of those "" look who's talking "" movies ( notice how they never called them look who's talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) .",positive
5215,"but somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again .",positive
5216,"weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named "" size isn't everything "" ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) .",positive
5217,"but now travolta's back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why .",positive
5218,four words : contract with the devil .,positive
5219,"and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich's "" contract with america . """,positive
5220,"no , satan is much more humane .",positive
5221,"anyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld .",positive
5222,how do i know ?,positive
5223,i own the document in question .,positive
5224,"amazing what you can buy at those collector's shops for a few hundred dollars , isn't it ?",positive
5225,"get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction , with travolta as crime minion chili palmer .",positive
5226,he goes to collect some of the mafia's money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game .,positive
5227,"sure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood , but i guess that's beside the point .",positive
5228,"palmer is determined to get hackman's next project made , so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) , who has already had affairs with hackman and devito .",positive
5229,"it doesn't take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial , which has been used in every comedy from "" who's the boss ? """,positive
5230,to speechless .,positive
5231,"it works in this case , unlike "" who's the boss ? """,positive
5232,although it's interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also .,positive
5233,"complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman's other films and want in on this one too , along with travolta's mob boss trying to track him down for defecting .",positive
5234,"get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities .",positive
5235,"this movie doesn't have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i've seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi ) .",positive
5236,"get shorty is my kind of movie , one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence .",positive
5237,i'm definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on .,positive
5238,"are you getting this , shorty ?",positive
5239,i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory .,positive
5240,"this was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this .",positive
5241,"not only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie .",positive
5242,"the very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city .",positive
5243,"gibson's performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films .",positive
5244,"gibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better .",positive
5245,the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique .,positive
5246,"try to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups .",positive
5247,"if you can imagine that , then you've basically got jerry fletcher .",positive
5248,"in many ways , i was surprised by this movie .",positive
5249,"to begin with , i was surprised at how good it was .",positive
5250,"don't get me wrong , it's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie .",positive
5251,"secondly , i was surprised at mel gibson's performance .",positive
5252,he provided a fantastic performance .,positive
5253,"the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense .",positive
5254,"gibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film .",positive
5255,"for instance , jerry's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable .",positive
5256,"and last , i was surprised at how good the plot is .",positive
5257,"writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher's far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland's own opinions .",positive
5258,mel gibson isn't the only stand-out in the film .,positive
5259,"julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can't seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories .",positive
5260,he also seems obsessed and in love with her .,positive
5261,"but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him .",positive
5262,"jerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) .",positive
5263,"although he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition .",positive
5264,"very soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) .",positive
5265,"after barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton .",positive
5266,"the remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry's life being constantly put into jeopardy .",positive
5267,"and more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry's life .",positive
5268,"many things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience .",positive
5269,"for instance , the meaning of the book "" the catcher in the rye "" and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g .",positive
5270,"lee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead .",positive
5271,"make sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above .",positive
5272,"definitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th , make sure you are standing in line to see it .",positive
5273,"i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations .",positive
5274,"and even if you aren't , you should still like this film .",positive
5275,"the disney studios has its formula for annual , full-length animated features down so pat that it's hard to remember which one you're watching at any given moment .",positive
5276,""" mulan , "" their 36th animated adventure , is the latest case in point .",positive
5277,"once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character ( female as usual ; disney is one of the few studios whose heroines--ariel , belle , pocahontas , and now mulan--get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years ) .",positive
5278,"add the requisite love interest and a wise-cracking sidekick or two , pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror , a rousing anthem , a cutesy , montage-backed crowd pleaser ) , pose a few threats to our engaging lead , and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits .",positive
5279,bob's your uncle !,positive
5280,better make that walt's your uncle . . .,positive
5281,"kids will no doubt go ga-ga over "" mulan "" ( or at least the fast food tie-ins ) , but familiarity can , after a while , leave grown-ups--this reviewer included--wishing for a little more .",positive
5282,maybe an animated feature without--shock !,positive
5283,horror ! --the,positive

5285,or maybe a film in which a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad ? ?,positive
5286,how about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether ?,positive
5287,it isn't gonna happen .,positive
5288,"like disney's previous entries , "" mulan "" is slow to make its mark .",positive
5289,"the animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and the humorous element , a madcap dragon wannabe ( in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth , courtesy eddie murphy's animated vocal talents ) , plays like an inappropriate if necessary ( formula-wise ) afterthought .",positive
5290,"however , after about an hour everything comes together and the formula , like it or not , clicks .",positive
5291,"highlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow-covered pass ( which , due to the sophistication of today's computer-generated imagery , is hard to tell from the real thing ) , a memorable , show-stopping musical interlude ( "" i'll make a man out of you , "" penned by matthew wilder and david zippel ) , and last but not least , mulan herself .",positive
5292,"voiced by ming-na wen , mulan is disney's strongest female character to date .",positive

5327,"the computer-animated comedy "" shrek "" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups .",positive
5328,"for children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) .",positive
5329,"for adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids .",positive
5330,"all in all , "" shrek "" is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing .",positive
5331,but first the basics .,positive
5332,"based very loosely on a 1990 children's story , "" shrek "" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using .",positive
5333,"shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace .",positive
5334,"petty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the "" awk "" in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides .",positive

5340,"the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of "" the dating game "" ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , "" even though she lives with seven men , she's not easy ! "" )",positive
5341,"farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds .",positive
5342,"shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend .",positive
5343,"they finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet .",positive
5344,"for the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well .",positive

5346,"that'll do "" ) to "" the graduate . """,positive
5347,but the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney .,positive
5348,"the public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a "" possessed toy "" and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , "" get that dead broad off the table ! """,positive
5349,"? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad's royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like "" it's a small world . """,positive
5350,which brings me to disturbing point number one .,positive
5351,"i laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad .",positive
5352,the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known .,positive
5353,for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day .,positive
5354,and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer .,positive
5355,here's a suggestion for the two boys : grow up !,positive
5356,put the past behind you !,positive
5357,"there's room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice , then go to your rooms !",positive
5358,the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad .,positive
5359,"beyond all the irreverence , "" shrek "" actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within .",positive
5360,"it's a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad's diminutive stature .",positive
5361,do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ?,positive
5362,"the pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers .",positive
5363,adding short jokes is simply mean .,positive
5364,"still , "" shrek "" is a rollicking good time .",positive
5365,"the computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one .",positive
5366,"to trot out a clich ? , "" shrek "" is fun for all ages .",positive
5367,"parents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing .",positive
5368,"after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again .",positive
5369,"there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice .",positive
5370,""" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , "" he says , "" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon . ' """,positive
5371,"of course , it's meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety .",positive
5372,"you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience .",positive
5373,"experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts .",positive
5374,"trust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point .",positive
5375,"juzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan .",positive
5376,"a stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) .",positive
5377,"goro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious .",positive
5378,"goro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen .",positive
5379,"the problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing .",positive
5380,"however , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy .",positive
5381,this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems .,positive
5382,"take , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner .",positive
5383,"the price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum .",positive
5384,"tampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room .",positive
5385,"she protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists .",positive
5386,"just when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door .",positive
5387,"she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience .",positive
5388,"this scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery .",positive
5389,"there's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers .",positive
5390,we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet .,positive
5391,"the scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all .",positive
5392,"there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives .",positive
5393,a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor .,positive
5394,"surrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life .",positive
5395,"her husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner .",positive
5396,"the viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this .",positive
5397,"in a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family .",positive
5398,"as the family eats , she looks on them and smiles .",positive
5399,"preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy .",positive
5400,"then she falls over , dead .",positive
5401,"for a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , "" keep eating !",positive
5402,"this is the last meal your mother ever made ! """,positive
5403,"crying as they do so , the family finishes the meal .",positive
5404,"the scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful .",positive
5405,"by including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline .",positive
5406,"instead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo's goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble .",positive
5407,"because the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the "" good guys "" come together for the final showdown .",positive
5408,"in this case , the showdown is against the ramen .",positive
5409,"if they eat tampopo's ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded .",positive
5410,"it's pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack .",positive
5411,there's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last .,positive
5412,george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy .,positive
5413,"return of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films .",positive
5414,"the dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone .",positive
5415,"instead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears .",positive
5416,even darth vader doesn't seem very intimidating this time around .,positive
5417,"with the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman .",positive
5418,return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back .,positive
5419,"luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke's home planet of tatooine .",positive
5420,their goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt .,positive
5421,"it is at jabba's home , a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts , that most of the added special effects come into play .",positive
5422,"from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba's sand barge , the effects are top notch .",positive
5423,"as soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt , it's back to outer space , where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire's newest threat : a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor .",positive
5424,"so , while the fleet prepares for the final battle , luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks .",positive
5425,"there , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear-like native race , and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader .",positive
5426,return of the jedi has some interesting elements .,positive
5427,the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted .,positive
5428,"from a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films .",positive
5429,"not only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved .",positive
5430,"on one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects .",positive
5431,"in the special edition , even more ships are added , making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch .",positive
5432,the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films .,positive
5433,"by now ( or then - 1983 ) , mark hamill , harrison ford , and carrie fisher have all matured in their on-screen personas .",positive
5434,the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific .,positive
5435,"as in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for .",positive
5436,"newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature , although he's not as imposing as vader was in star wars .",positive
5437,"although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen , return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment .",positive
5438,"with the spectacular , new special effects , the adorable ewoks , the sinister jabba the hutt , the evil emperor , the same old millenium falcon , darth vader's incredible betrayal , the destruction of the new death star , and the always lovable yoda , return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang .",positive

5441,why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ?,positive

5443,""" the iron giant , "" which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as "" the simpsons "" and "" king of the hill , "" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time .",positive

5451,"it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security .",positive

5454,""" the iron giant "" is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience .",positive
5455,"the story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy .",positive
5456,"it's very similar to the spielberg classic "" e . t . , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of "" the iron giant . """,positive
5457,"the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy .",positive

5459,hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero .,positive
5460,"the final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed .",positive
5461,"the animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after "" tarzan "" ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon .",positive
5462,"the giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way .",positive
5463,"the characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief .",positive
5464,"fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother .",positive
5465,"harry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's "" frasier "" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley .",positive
5466,"unlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched ) .",positive
5467,"dean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations .",positive
5468,"even the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia .",positive
5469,"a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind , but "" the iron giant "" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off .",positive
5470,"the film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though .",positive
5471,"it's also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy .",positive
5472,"the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on "" the simpsons "" for many years .",positive
5473,"a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to "" outlast "" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever .",positive
5474,"the film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to "" duck and cover "" in the event of a nuclear attack .",positive

5491,"writer/director francis verber artfully milks the farcical comedy as he dissects the hypocrisy of political correctness , veering off-track only occasionally into pedophilia .",positive
5492,"daniel auteuil ( "" the widow of saint-pierre "" ) is delightful - particularly with a blown-up condom perched on his head , riding on a float in a gay pride parade - and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained , and effective , performances .",positive
5493,"on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" the closet "" is a frankly sexual , adult 8 .",positive

5495,roman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor .,positive

5501,"gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania , and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required "" 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence "" style of moviemaking .",positive
5502,the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used . . .,positive
5503,it's choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting .,positive

5527,"reed's death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem , as he still had scenes to be completed .",positive
5528,"rather than recast the role ( and end up reshooting a great deal of footage ) , a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars .",positive
5529,"ironically , that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film .",positive
5530,"anyway , this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of ( for about twenty seconds ) and if you aren't looking for it you won't even be able to tell .",positive
5531,some of the other digital effects are less convincing however . . .,positive
5532,"and like i always say , noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately .",positive
5533,it's sad that such a good film has these distractions .,positive

5554,"and although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido = to dora ( played by nicoletta braschi , benigni+s real life wife ) , a silent undercurrent creeps in .",positive
5555,"this is clearly a racist society , evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others , and it will soon affect him and = his family .",positive

5558,"for = his wife , who is separated from him , he must find ways to communicate to = her that he is all right .",positive
5559,"for his son , ( and this is the most controversial part of the film ) he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game : it+s rules include hiding , being very quiet , and learning to not ask for seconds .",positive
5560,which raises the big questions : how do we deal with pain ?,positive
5561,with persecution ?,positive
5562,with injustice on the worst level ?,positive

5569,"his liberty is stripped , but not his dignity , and certainly not the dignities of those around him .",positive
5570,"it+s obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation , but does so with a grinning , joyful demeanor .",positive

5590,synopsis : great expectations ( 1998 ) is a modernized version of a charles dickens novel .,positive
5591,"in the original charles dickens classic an orphan boy named pip learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict , his relationship with a bitter old lady named miss havisham , and his hopeless lifetime infatuation with havisham's snobbish adopted daughter , estella .",positive
5592,"the gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends pip to london for pip to become an upper class "" gentleman . """,positive
5593,"pip leaves for london with "" great expectations "" to be groomed into a gentleman so that he can one day be classy enough to marry estella .",positive
5594,but life has a way of complicating things .,positive
5595,pip becomes an arrogant s . o . b .,positive
5596,until he learns just who his secret benefactor is .,positive
5597,in this new 1998 version of great expectations a poor florida lad named finn ( ethan hawke ) with a talent for drawing has an early memory of helping an escaped convict ( robert de niro ) .,positive
5598,"but soon the focus of finn's life becomes romance , as he develops a lifelong infatuation with estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , an upper crust girl with some psychological and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment .",positive
5599,"estella was raised in wealth by ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , an eccentric , aged and embittered , man-hating single aunt whose groom left her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage .",positive
5600,"this causes estella to 'fear the daylight' of relationships , but finn thinks it's just a case of snobbery .",positive
5601,"when finn becomes a young man , an anonymous benefactor sets finn up in new york with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous artist .",positive
5602,"finn leaves florida with "" great expectations "" to be a successful artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the snobbish estella .",positive
5603,"what will happen to all of finn's "" great expectations ? """,positive
5604,"opinion : if you're looking for a romance with a happy ending , look no further ; you've found one here .",positive
5605,ethan hawke is romantic lead .,positive
5606,( he romanced winona ryder in reality bites .,positive
5607,he romanced julie delpy in before sunrise .,positive
5608,he romanced uma thurman in gattaca .,positive
5609,"now in great expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow , a rail-thin blonde . )",positive
5610,"hawke plays a lovestruck , earnest and unchanged finn throughout the film .",positive
5611,meanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease and ice princess ; estella's whole purpose is to get men to fall in love and then hurt them rather than become intimate .,positive
5612,"anne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic ms . dinsmoor , while robert de niro carries off the convict part suitably .",positive
5613,"the difference between the classic dickens novel and this 1998 adaptation is that the dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless themes about class struggle and love , whereas great expectations ( 1998 ) is more artsy , less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with a lifetime tease .",positive
5614,"you've seen this moment before , recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing .",positive
5615,"the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor's nell in the haunting , we don't care .",positive
5616,"the hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike .",positive
5617,the seasons have changed since an ex-patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom .,positive
5618,"desperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ) , malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) .",positive
5619,the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm's would-be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret .,positive
5620,"only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine-tingling scene , that he sees dead people walking among us , all the time .",positive
5621,"malcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so , that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic , but the sincerity in cole's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures .",positive
5622,"he will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process .",positive
5623,the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist .,positive
5624,"( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter . )",positive
5625,"it's far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks .",positive
5626,"cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they're not out to harm him , really-they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler .",positive
5627,"perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we're looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old .",positive
5628,"that's right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar .",positive
5629,"we appreciate malcolm's domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed .",positive
5630,"both actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest .",positive
5631,"willis convinces us that he's a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night .",positive
5632,"osment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do .",positive
5633,"the sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama-its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading .",positive
5634,"only because i was expecting something different did i notice-rather , feel-the movie's running time , which is just shy of two hours .",positive
5635,the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait .,positive
5636,"i'm not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity .",positive
5637,hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest ) .,positive
5638,"it's a shame , too , because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters .",positive
5639,"i mean , come on .",positive
5640,are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ?,positive
5641,hell no .,positive
5642,"and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell , but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films .",positive
5643,"and not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk 'till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either .",positive
5644,this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu .,positive
5645,"i got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays .",positive
5646,and that is exactly what this film is ; art .,positive
5647,"i've been a horror fan since i was eight years old , and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers .",positive
5648,let me backtrack a minute .,positive
5649,"when i say "" intellectual ground "" , i don't mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that , i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to , a little bit of thinking is involved .",positive
5650,"with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown .",positive
5651,those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen .,positive
5652,"you see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore .",positive
5653,this is a thinking man's slasher flick .,positive
5654,"the "" nosferatu "" of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit-like count that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy .",positive
5655,"he employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder ) .",positive
5656,"upon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock's castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutter's ) .",positive
5657,"the next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck . . . not",positive
5658,really a good sign .,positive
5659,"he then discovers through some reading that the count is a "" nosferatu "" , or vampire , one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans .",positive
5660,"but by the time he pieces this together , he is too late ; orlock has already embarked to hutter's hometown via boat .",positive
5661,will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ?,positive
5662,"the character of orlock is , of course , dracula .",positive
5663,the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker's novel .,positive
5664,just thought that was an interesting little side note . . .,positive
5665,"probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment's digitally restored cut , now available in stores .",positive
5666,"however , this version is quite different than maunau's original masterpiece .",positive
5667,"the movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o-negative and color tinting , much like the 1984 version of lang's metropolis .",positive
5668,"now , i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here , bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one .",positive
5669,"but alas , i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen .",positive
5670,"but that's just my bag ; you may like the newer , more "" modern "" version better .",positive
5671,"either way , i suggest investing your money in a copy .",positive
5672,"if you like what they have done with it , pop it in the vcr and enjoy .",positive
5673,"if you're like me , just do what i'll do during future viewings ; turn the color all the way down on your television , hit mute , turn on some bach or mozart or whatever , dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made .",positive
5674,"stendhal's syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder .",positive
5675,"grim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy's master of the horror thriller dario argento .",positive
5676,"boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone , the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento .",positive
5677,"it follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 ) , the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980's .",positive
5678,"based on the novel by graziella magherini , the film stars argento's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer .",positive
5679,"visiting florence to follow up several leads , she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery , a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail .",positive
5680,at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints .,positive
5681,"posing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins .",positive
5682,"a gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with argento's often lumpy narratives .",positive
5683,the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario .,positive
5684,it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character's psychological disintegration .,positive
5685,"the script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers .",positive
5686,"but as dark as its themes are , the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years .",positive
5687,"argento is once again working in his native italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences .",positive
5688,"effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent .",positive
5689,"the film's opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style .",positive
5690,"proof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world's most exhilarating filmmakers .",positive
5691,"the cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless .",positive
5692,"asia argento's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating .",positive
5693,"it's a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts .",positive
5694,"thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo , and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as anna's work colleague and increasingly confused love interest .",positive
5695,but perhaps the stendhal syndrome's single most striking element is ennio morricone's soundtrack .,positive
5696,"active since the 1960's , morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts .",positive
5697,"it's mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards .",positive
5698,it's been three decades since argento and morricone worked together .,positive
5699,this is a long welcome reunion .,positive
5700,"if the film has a fault , it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn't quite reach a completely satisfying climax .",positive
5701,"but by the closing scenes , the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento's career .",positive
5702,* note : see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can .,positive
5703,dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web .,positive
5704,"close your eyes for a moment , if you will , and imagine the sound of stephen rea's gaelic brogue , silky smooth and irish like a pint of guinness .",positive
5705,"a lackadaisical , naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts and gambols .",positive
5706,"an acerbic , sing-song metered voice that evokes the startling imagery and language of anthony burgess' "" a clockwork orange . """,positive
5707,"a voice that deliciously conjures scenes both porcine and puerile , like those out of "" delicatessen , "" or "" the tin drum . """,positive
5708,"imagine all of that , and you'll get a good sense of what you can expect from "" the butcher boy . """,positive
5709,imagine that and more .,positive
5710,"neil jordan's latest film "" stars "" rea in more ways than one .",positive
5711,"rea , the accomplished irish actor most notable from his star turn in jordan's "" the crying game , "" contributes a restrained and managed performance as da brady , a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the 1960s .",positive
5712,"but it's his wall-to-wall narration as the butcher boy of the title , da brady's son , francis , that makes rea's "" performance "" worth watching , worth listening to .",positive
5713,and that's only half the fun .,positive
5714,"playing the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens and he is , without a doubt , a revelation .",positive
5715,"for as much as rea's voiceover permeates almost every scene of "" the butcher boy , "" owens commands virtually every frame .",positive
5716,it's impossible to take your eyes off him .,positive
5717,"with his crop of carrot-colored hair , ruddy complexion , and overall grubby appearance , francie brady is an unlikely hero , refusing to be done in by his alcoholic , trumpet-playing father , his depressive , suicidal mother , or the neighboring , bespectacled monster known as mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) .",positive
5718,"in fact , everything was ok until "" the nugent "" came to town .",positive
5719,"now , she poses as much a threat to the safety and security of town bully francie and his best pal joe ( alan boyle ) as the looming commie menace ( "" the butcher boy "" is set at a time when the fear of nuclear obliteration is first and foremost in the minds of many ) .",positive
5720,""" pigs ! "" screams mrs . nugent at the brady menagerie .",positive
5721,""" you're all pigs ! """,positive
5722,it's the start of many a related image .,positive
5723,"after ma brady is shipped off to the "" garage "" for psychiatric observation and da brady downs one bottle of whiskey too many , francie finally loses grip of his fantasy world of cowboys and indians , the lone ranger , and other comicbook characters .",positive
5724,"squealing like a stuck pig , francie does "" the likes o' that "" on the nugent's living room floor , and is himself whisked away to a very catholic remand home for "" boney arsed bogmen , "" where his ever fertile imagination--and clever chicanery--runneth over .",positive
5725,"director jordan's vivid treatment of pat mccabe's nightmare novel produces a sometimes disturbing , dark comedy littered with surreal touches ( such as sin ? ad o'connor playing the virgin mary ) .",positive
5726,"it's not as outlandish as the trailers make out ; instead , this remarkable film focuses on the effects external influences have on the friendship between two boys ( schoolboy chums in real life ) , allowing us to empathize with their plight in the presence of extraordinary behavior .",positive
5727,it's bleak and it's black but it's fundamentally very funny .,positive
5728,"rea talks us through it , beautifully , and owens drags us though it , admirably , and , in tandem with jordan's sure hand , theirs are contributions to make "" the butcher boy "" a film worth savoring .",positive
5729,"zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film .",positive
5730,"zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he'd like to think so ) .",positive
5731,"however , he's a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are .",positive
5732,"zero's accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a "" normal "" guy who does the business side of the job -- he's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator .",positive
5733,the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero's talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o'neal ) .,positive
5734,"it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about .",positive
5735,"zero takes the case , and the plot thickens .",positive
5736,"his path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) .",positive
5737,"despite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark .",positive
5738,"through his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him .",positive
5739,i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film .,positive
5740,"i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown's greatness ) .",positive
5741,"zero effect , which is jake kasdan's first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it's an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture .",positive
5742,"with so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them .",positive
5743,"but he didn't just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment .",positive
5744,"take , for starters , the great cast of characters .",positive
5745,"pullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven't seen from him since spaceballs .",positive
5746,"zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe .",positive
5747,"pullman's performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious .",positive
5748,ben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny .,positive
5749,""" i'll shoot you , "" he says to stark at one point .",positive
5750,""" i have a gun , and everything . """,positive
5751,"his character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job .",positive
5752,"o'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs .",positive
5753,i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film .,positive
5754,"kasdan's humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) .",positive
5755,it's the kind of humor that's funny even after you've seen it five or six times .,positive
5756,"there's one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective .",positive
5757,"what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular .",positive
5758,"i can't convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero .",positive
5759,"as a side note , i don't consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa .",positive
5760,"there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it .",positive
5761,"i have a feeling the humor here won't appeal to everyone , but there's certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone's interest .",positive
5762,"jake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old .",positive
5763,"i found this out after seeing the film , and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker .",positive
5764,"his direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed .",positive
5765,"zero effect is the kind of film that i'll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul .",positive
5766,"at the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome .",positive
5767,"and , with kasdan's undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future .",positive
5768,the long kiss goodnight ( r ) meryl streep tried it and failed .,positive

5770,"however , geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight , a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband , renny harlin .",positive
5771,"davis plays samantha caine , a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years .",positive
5772,"with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey ( samuel l . jackson ) , she slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as charly baltimore , tough-as-nails cia operative .",positive
5773,"needless to say , with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than her memory .",positive
5774,"shane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script ; i'm not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag , but for what it's worth , it delivers the goods .",positive
5775,"like black's previous work , such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout , the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny , quirky dialogue .",positive
5776,"the humor especially works well in this case , for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously .",positive
5777,but there's no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell : who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car . . .,positive
5778,while ice skating ?,positive
5779,jackson and davis make a good team .,positive
5780,"jackson is funny as ever as ever ; in fact , his spirited line deliveries , especially when he first appears , are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction .",positive
5781,"as good as he is , the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis , who shows much promise as an action heroine .",positive
5782,what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn't take herself too seriously .,positive
5783,"she is obviously in on the joke , slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation .",positive
5784,"this is not to say that she doesn't need work--sometimes she lays on the "" toughness "" a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature .",positive
5785,"but should the public embrace the film and , in turn , the notion of a kick-ass female , davis could have found her special niche .",positive
5786,"it seems as if davis and harlin's first collaboration , the middling pirate epic cutthroat island , was just a dress rehearsal ( albeit a very costly one ) for long kiss , in which the wife-husband team hit their action stride .",positive
5787,"anyone simply looking for a fun , escapist entertainment that requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome kiss .",positive
5788,screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker .,positive
5789,screenplay by andrew kevin walker .,positive
5790,inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving .,positive
5791,directed by tim burton .,positive
5792,"starring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien .",positive
5793,special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken .,positive
5794,synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation .,positive
5795,townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them .,positive
5796,cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery .,positive
5797,comments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years .,positive
5798,"batman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels .",positive
5799,"he's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) .",positive
5800,"sleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies .",positive
5801,"sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe .",positive
5802,"christopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders .",positive
5803,the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s .,positive
5804,one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein .,positive
5805,i mention these allusions for a reason .,positive
5806,"seasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film .",positive
5807,"with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this .",positive
5808,"not only does it have a sense of history , but burton's skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror .",positive
5809,"the film's eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie .",positive
5810,"johnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving's original story and is now an investigator .",positive
5811,depp is adequate in his role .,positive
5812,no more ; no less .,positive
5813,"equally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film .",positive
5814,she's a good witch too .,positive
5815,how cute .,positive
5816,one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters .,positive
5817,"the two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine .",positive
5818,veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers .,positive
5819,"while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing .",positive
5820,you have to pay attention .,positive
5821,andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay .,positive
5822,he's the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven .,positive
5823,"walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly doesn't hurt his growing reputation .",positive
5824,"as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic .",positive
5825,there's a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings .,positive
5826,this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to .,positive
5827,a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest's eyes with her hand .,positive
5828,he was obviously upset by the movie's intense violence .,positive
5829,"if you're looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended .",positive
5830,"mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . )",positive
5831,"with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest "" hot properties "" in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time .",positive
5832,"for over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy .",positive
5833,""" drunken master "" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to "" make it big "" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong .",positive
5834,"i'm not entirely sure why , exactly .",positive
5835,"in many ways , "" drunken master "" is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii , "" master with cracked fingers "" , "" half a loaf of kung fu "" , "" spiritual kung fu "" , and others .",positive
5836,"in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories .",positive
5837,"to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste .",positive
5838,they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america .,positive
5839,"these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together .",positive
5840,""" drunken master "" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception .",positive
5841,"( as an aside , "" drunken master "" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in",positive
5842,"a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival .",positive
5843,"at the time , i didn't really think it was anything special . . . but",positive
5844,"after having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me . )",positive
5845,""" drunken master "" 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii and "" master with cracked fingers "" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been "" adapted , "" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) .",positive
5846,"more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka "" naughty panther , "" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough .",positive
5847,"after embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and",positive
5848,"is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively .",positive
5849,"his father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages .",positive
5850,"kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all .",positive
5851,"while escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more .",positive
5852,"this turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu .",positive
5853,"he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up .",positive
5854,"then , when he's ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu .",positive
5855,"unfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . .",positive
5856,""" drunken master "" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others .",positive
5857,"it's been said before , but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ , they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows .",positive
5858,"in his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways .",positive
5859,"the fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films .",positive
5860,"whether jackie wins or loses , it's really something to see . . . and",positive
5861,"it's often as funny as anything , too .",positive
5862,"and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at .",positive
5863,"there's very little that's new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these",positive
5864,"schticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties .",positive
5865,but they're still hilarious as ever .,positive
5866,"likewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own .",positive
5867,"the really big thing about "" drunken master "" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu .",positive
5868,"i'm not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and",positive
5869,it apparently helps if you're drunk while you're doing it .,positive
5870,"genuine or not , i have to admit , there's just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what's going on .",positive
5871,"come to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film's success over any of the other jackie films . . . it's",positive
5872,"not just martial arts , it's the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , "" whoa . . . """,positive
5873,"on the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background .",positive
5874,""" gone with the wind "" , this isn't .",positive
5875,"still , if you like martial arts films , or like what you've seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot .",positive
5876,"it's much more "" real "" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme .",positive
5877,you might very well like it .,positive
5878,"another interesting thing about "" drunken master "" has to do with its video availability in the us .",positive
5879,""" drunken master "" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) .",positive
5880,"there are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase .",positive
5881,"thankfully , "" drunken master "" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price .",positive
5882,"if you like "" drunken master "" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren't really _too_ bad . . . if",positive
5883,"nothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) .",positive
5884,"i particularly recommend "" spiritual kung fu "" , "" half a loaf of kung fu "" , the "" fearless hyena "" movies , and "" snake & crane arts of shaolin "" .",positive
5885,"also , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , "" drunken master ii "" , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer .",positive
5886,"also , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i've been told to suggest the "" once upon a time in china "" series starring jet li ( though i haven't personally seen any of them yet ) .",positive
5887,"if you choose to watch "" drunken master "" , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that's out there .",positive
5888,"all in all , i give this film an .",positive
5889,"well , i know that stallone is 50 years old now , but in daylight he doesn't look it !",positive
5890,daylight is a great disaster movie .,positive
5891,"if you've seen cliffhanger , you'll know stallone's character already .",positive
5892,"a guy with a bad past , but is in the right place at the wrong time .",positive
5893,a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying * very * flammable toxic waste .,positive
5894,a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball ( and what a fire ball it was ! ),positive
5895,"stallone , a former emergency medical service man , is chauffeuring a rich couple around , when they reach the outside of the tunnel , before the explosion .",positive
5896,"then , 30 minutes into the movie , boom !",positive
5897,">from here on , the plot takes a back seat , and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged .",positive
5898,most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat .,positive
5899,"there are a few melodramatic parts here , but , they tend to work out well .",positive
5900,"there is no general antagonist in this film , but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that .",positive
5901,"daylight is a great film , i saw a non-matinee showing of it , and i thought it was worth every penny .",positive
5902,"the characterizations are mostly flat , one dimesional , but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters .",positive
5903,rob cohen ( dragonheart ) does a great job with this film .,positive
5904,logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility .,positive
5905,"considering that the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task .",positive
5906,"occasionally , we get a film that does manage it .",positive
5907,"terry gilliam's "" 12 monkeys "" was one such film .",positive
5908,"but more frequently , we get films that don't much deal with it at all .",positive
5909,there is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ?,positive
5910,"the "" terminator "" films made up for them with exciting action , "" back to the future "" did it with an entertaining story , and the new film "" frequency "" pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own .",positive
5911,"is "" frequency "" filled with plot holes ?",positive
5912,yes .,positive
5913,does it matter ?,positive
5914,not really .,positive
5915,the film opens in october of 1969 .,positive
5916,"firefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) .",positive
5917,"the double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective .",positive
5918,a strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in '69 and that john has found in the present day .,positive
5919,"though both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom .",positive
5920,"now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women .",positive
5921,"frank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past .",positive
5922,"the premise of "" frequency "" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions .",positive
5923,this isn't explained ; you just have to go with it .,positive
5924,"when frank doesn't die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way .",positive
5925,the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other .,positive
5926,"sometimes frank's changing the past results in something happening right away in john's world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time .",positive
5927,"now , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer's murders was because the change had already happened in frank's world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren't really the point .",positive
5928,"when "" frequency "" gets cooking , it's a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing .",positive
5929,"what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and "" frequency "" works as long as it keeps moving .",positive
5930,the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion .,positive
5931,"director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure "" frequency "" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved .",positive
5932,"i liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward .",positive
5933,it actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john's advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him .,positive
5934,"( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . )",positive
5935,"i even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods .",positive
5936,"some may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let's face it : it's a darn cool way to end the film .",positive
5937,"there are enough surprises and plot twists in "" frequency "" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant .",positive
5938,"the other major thing to appreciate about "" frequency "" is the handling of the father-son relationship .",positive
5939,quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it's a rock-solid job from both actors .,positive
5940,"the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ?",positive
5941,watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question .,positive
5942,"the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don't believe in the characters , we don't care about the outcome of the thriller plot .",positive
5943,"here , we do care , because we like the lead actors .",positive
5944,i also liked some of the supporting cast members .,positive
5945,"elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably .",positive
5946,"andre braugher , late of the television show "" homicide : life on the street , "" gives a nice supporting turn as frank's best friend and future colleague of john .",positive
5947,he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank's world series predictions come true before his very eyes .,positive
5948,"braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused .",positive
5949,"perhaps the only thing i didn't like about "" frequency "" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera's focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard .",positive
5950,but that's only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics .,positive
5951,"i freely acknowledge that "" frequency "" may best work as a "" guy "" movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of "" field of dreams "" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable .",positive
5952,who wouldn't want to speak with a long-dead parent ?,positive
5953,or see how their children turn out ?,positive
5954,""" tell me about your life , son "" -- excuse me while i mist up .",positive
5955,and don't call me a sissy .,positive
5956,blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood's premier leading men .,positive
5957,blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it .,positive
5958,it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well .,positive
5959,"although , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie .",positive
5960,"the ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story .",positive
5961,"but at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once .",positive
5962,"that really doesn't take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit .",positive
5963,"blade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire .",positive
5964,his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire .,positive
5965,including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust .,positive
5966,blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother .,positive
5967,"but this isn't as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade's world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films .",positive
5968,"the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires .",positive
5969,where do vampires get money ?,positive
5970,"well , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations .",positive
5971,"i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie .",positive
5972,blade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community .,positive
5973,"he isn't content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority .",positive
5974,he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable .,positive
5975,it's up to blade to see that this doesn't transpire .,positive
5976,"admittedly , blade is style over substance through and through .",positive
5977,"the story is a relatively forgettable one , but it is fun none the less .",positive
5978,the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type .,positive
5979,"this isn't a film that is going to win accolades for its performances , and the actors know this .",positive
5980,the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise .,positive
5981,"it's a popcorn movie , and no one involved has any illusions otherwise .",positive
5982,blade's production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster .,positive
5983,the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done .,positive
5984,"although , the mtv-style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences .",positive
5985,blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre .,positive
5986,this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle .,positive
5987,what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life .,positive
5988,very cool .,positive

5990,"in case you've been asleep for the last few months , the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven .",positive
5991,"his life seems so perfect , however , because it's controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show , the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of .",positive
5992,"that's right , burbank's life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it's inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage .",positive
5993,the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . .,positive
5994,"with an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator .",positive
5995,"luckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie .",positive
5996,"talking of carrey , he's perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career .",positive
5997,his character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey's persona .,positive
5998,"he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly , but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey .",positive
5999,"he's not completely dramatic like the film promises , however .",positive
6000,"ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show .",positive
6001,"quiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer .",positive
6002,"unfortunately , he's barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen't appear at all !",positive
6003,also disappointing is natascha mcelhone's character sylvia .,positive
6004,"she plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her .",positive
6005,"the supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it's creepy .",positive
6006,"the philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film .",positive
6007,"peter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun .",positive
6008,the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card .,positive
6009,"although it is slightly slow to begin with , about half an hour into film the pace really picks up , and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll .",positive
6010,"sadly , though , the film is practically over when the film is in full steam .",positive
6011,"also , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous , which was disappointing .",positive
6012,"the screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim .",positive
6013,"while christoff's plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly , they never go over the line , which would have been easy for niccol to do .",positive
6014,"also , there's some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show .",positive
6015,"overall , the truman show is excellent entertainment .",positive
6016,"certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces , it should be viewed by everyone .",positive

6020,""" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes",positive
6021,"no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan's harrowing , humorous , horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe's novel about young lad francie brady's ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland .",positive
6022,"on one hand , it was difficult for me to become invested in francie's story because he is such an unsavory character , unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) .",positive
6023,"on another hand , i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie's darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick , needy child , having been raised by a drunken father ( stephen rea ) and a suicidal mother ( aisling o'sullivan ) .",positive
6024,"on yet another hand , i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his , for lack of a better word , "" bad "" deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them .",positive
6025,"however , the butcher boy's power is undeniable , and the film as a whole is unforgettable--perhaps because it is so disturbing .",positive
6026,"what makes it so unsettling is the francie's overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude about everything , expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie ( rea again ) .",positive
6027,"think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs , and you'll sort of understand .",positive
6028,"anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens ; love francie or hate him , you cannot take your eyes off of owens .",positive
6029,"the butcher boy truly is a twisted , unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable .",positive
6030,"in the lobby after the screening , i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was ; i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust , "" that movie was so unfunny ! """,positive

6040,"the familiar lethal weapon family is back , including rene russo , who is now the expectant mother of riggs' child and joe pesci as the soprana-like , foul-mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye .",positive
6041,"new to the team is chris rock , also a fast-talking , up and coming detective .",positive
6042,"trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go , and in this film , that is no exception .",positive
6043,"even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride , they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship .",positive
6044,"we here some ominous music , which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen .",positive

6046,"although they don't know what they're looking for , their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action .",positive
6047,and there's plenty of action here for two movies .,positive
6048,"led by fighting sensation jet li , whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive , he does what he can to make sure that no one finds out what they are up to .",positive
6049,"li is ruthless in his approach , will kill anyone just to make a point , and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives .",positive
6050,"there are terrific car chases , explosions and gunshot galore .",positive
6051,"it's a summer action recipe followed to the letter , and the result is nothing less than pure , unadulterated summer fun .",positive
6052,but even too many explosions can get boring .,positive
6053,"to counter that , we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li .",positive
6054,"luckily , he'd rather fight hand-to-hand instead of firing off guns .",positive
6055,"meanwhile , when the detectives aren't reloading their guns or running from fireballs , they're engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets .",positive
6056,everybody gets in on the shtick .,positive
6057,"russo screams during her delivery , the crime lord has a few funny bits when he's being interrogated while being given laughing gas , and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones .",positive
6058,gibson and glover are always in sync and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano .,positive
6059,score one for the old guard .,positive
6060,"since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style .",positive
6061,"now , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow .",positive
6062,"this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993's schindler's list shows .",positive
6063,"most of today's mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience .",positive
6064,"that's why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema .",positive
6065,"the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950's company town of coalwood , west virginia .",positive
6066,it's a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine .,positive
6067,"the mine , which is run by homer's father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however .",positive
6068,"after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , "" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . """,positive
6069,"drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets .",positive
6070,"with the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things .",positive
6071,"october sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston .",positive
6072,johnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he's doing here .,positive
6073,he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust .,positive
6074,"he does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film's charm .",positive
6075,"his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer's mother and father .",positive
6076,"the cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles .",positive
6077,"laura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need .",positive
6078,her role is instantly likeable .,positive
6079,"chris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer's father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie .",positive
6080,"he's definitely a driving force in homer's life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable .",positive
6081,"the script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys' endeavors in a lighthearted manner .",positive
6082,there are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist .,positive
6083,"it highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps .",positive
6084,october sky should be a success with audiences .,positive
6085,"although it doesn't have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she's all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards .",positive
6086,"it's a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see .",positive
6087,a big surprise to me .,positive
6088,"the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope .",positive
6089,they replaced him just fine .,positive
6090,"not with john goodman , he didn't do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can really sing .",positive
6091,"the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who's ten .",positive
6092,"this was another of my fears for the film , but he's a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed ) .",positive
6093,"things that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all .",positive
6094,"i'm quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing .",positive
6095,"there's a few early crashes , and then one huge pile-up , but after that it all stops .",positive
6096,it's just the music .,positive
6097,"one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway's song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him , but there's no problems with this .",positive
6098,"the music is all as good as ever , tons of great musicians showing up -- with the exception of johnny lang , who can't sing , all the musicians do a great job .",positive
6099,the only real problems i had was the special effects .,positive
6100,these were superfluous and a waste of money .,positive

6131,"disappointingly , david alan grier's charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written .",positive
6132,duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder .,positive

6136,"though an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses .",positive
6137,"while "" return to me "" functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop .",positive
6138,the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife's heart .,positive
6139,"we already know that there's going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point .",positive

6164,"however , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place .",positive

6166,suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film .,positive
6167,"campbell is very successful with this character , adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch .",positive
6168,playing kelly van ryan is denise richards .,positive
6169,"kelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra .",positive
6170,one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother .,positive
6171,"denise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film .",positive
6172,"in the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character , but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well .",positive
6173,kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette .,positive
6174,"this character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film .",positive
6175,"however , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story .",positive
6176,"still , the film doesn't seem to gain much from bacon's performance , only his name .",positive
6177,"in the supporting cast , theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan , daphne rubin-vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez , and bill murray shines as sam's lawyer , ken bowden .",positive
6178,hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film .,positive
6179,"although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller , the eroticism , which is portrayed with good taste , is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters .",positive

6201,being an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons .,positive
6202,so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own .,positive

6206,"yes , after 57 years ripley has sex .",positive
6207,"it is not gratuitous , in fact , we don't even see them kiss , but it is just as well .",positive
6208,a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film .,positive
6209,there is a lot more gore in alien 3 .,positive
6210,in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two .,positive
6211,it also sports a new alien with 4 legs !,positive

6223,"elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the "" alien "" series been set in .",positive
6224,this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner's aliens ) .,positive
6225,this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring .,positive
6226,this is a great score .,positive
6227,the ending to alien 3 is quite good .,positive
6228,"there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely .",positive
6229,i will not ruin the ending for you .,positive
6230,go see the film .,positive
6231,i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season .,positive
6232,alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien .,positive
6233,"and when they make alien 4 , perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in .",positive
6234,are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store ?,positive
6235,wafflemovies . com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves .,positive
6236,"everyweek , wafflemovies . com",positive
6237,reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video .,positive
6238,here is a sample review :,positive
6239,welcome to sarajevo,positive
6240,"in light of america's recent intervention in kosovo , welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years .",positive
6241,"set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events , this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war .",positive
6242,the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding .,positive
6243,"as they make their way down the street , a sniper shoots the mother of the bride .",positive
6244,yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war .,positive
6245,"in this scene , we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson ) , an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church .",positive
6246,"joe is cocky , but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn't even know .",positive
6247,his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane ) .,positive
6248,michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world's lack of interest .,positive
6249,henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread .,positive
6250,he decides to take action when a united nations' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth .,positive
6251,henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines .,positive
6252,he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult .,positive
6253,"during his visits , he befriends a pre-teen girl , emira ( emira nuseric ) who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner .",positive
6254,he promises to get emira out of harm's way if he gets the chance .,positive
6255,"after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children , henderson loses hope .",positive
6256,"however , his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina ( marisa tomei ) and her children's aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans .",positive
6257,"unfortunately , only babies are wanted for adoption , so henderson pledges to take emira to england .",positive
6258,"the group of children , nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy .",positive
6259,can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ?,positive
6260,the movie was beautifully and sensitively made .,positive
6261,director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred .,positive
6262,"they show the destroyed lives , families that have been split up , and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with .",positive
6263,"this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended .",positive
6264,the group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities .,positive
6265,one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth .,positive
6266,"like the rest of those deeply effected by the war , this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live .",positive
6267,winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room .,positive
6268,the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics .,positive
6269,winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities .,positive
6270,this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies . com,positive
6271,selection mad city .,positive
6272,"we watch them struggle to cover the horror , while trying to remain professionally detached .",positive
6273,"however , they are human and question the reason behind it all , why no one cares , and how they can get out .",positive
6274,stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson .,positive
6275,he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events .,positive
6276,dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy .,positive
6277,"henderson realizes that he cannot save the world , but he can help a few .",positive
6278,it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary-sandra bullock disaster two if by sea .,positive
6279,"woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest , most versatile actors of his generation .",positive
6280,harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character's caring nature and vulnerability shine through .,positive
6281,"harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men ( cheers , white men can't jump ) as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one .",positive
6282,"this ability will serve him well and give him a long , successful career .",positive
6283,america's involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place .,positive
6284,"for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict , the entire movie , most importantly the opening scenes , provide a history lesson .",positive
6285,war is a foreign concept to most of us in america .,positive
6286,battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to .,positive
6287,televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war .,positive
6288,"this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world , something we don't do enough of in 90's america .",positive
6289,many people dislike french films for their lack of closure .,positive
6290,"while possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view .",positive
6291,"there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) .",positive
6292,stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker .,positive
6293,he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing .,positive
6294,"even the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches .",positive
6295,"in the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man .",positive
6296,camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes .,positive
6297,maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife .,positive
6298,"like stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges .",positive
6299,"when stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals .",positive
6300,"however , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him .",positive
6301,"stephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present .",positive
6302,"as the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another .",positive
6303,"these two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently .",positive
6304,"stephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship .",positive
6305,"however , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation .",positive
6306,"the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher .",positive
6307,"however , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing .",positive
6308,"consequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays .",positive
6309,"in contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier .",positive
6310,"however , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing .",positive
6311,"during the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions .",positive
6312,stephane attempts to remain unchanged .,positive
6313,"however , we do see subtle hints of his transformation .",positive
6314,one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash .,positive
6315,"the development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible .",positive
6316,"american movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development .",positive
6317,"in its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane .",positive
6318,"the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters .",positive
6319,"i am not sure why berardinelli says , "" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . """,positive
6320,"this movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are .",positive
6321,"i find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling .",positive
6322,"this portion of the film is where the "" sense of closure "" could have been successfully accomplished .",positive
6323,"unfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters .",positive
6324,"while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film .",positive
6325,the synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen .,positive
6326,the directing in this movie is wonderful .,positive
6327,"the actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth .",positive
6328,emmanuelle beart's personality is beautiful .,positive
6329,"and needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful .",positive
6330,"besides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral .",positive
6331,i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of .,positive
6332,"the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ?",positive
6333,"i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing .",positive
6334,"in summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship .",positive
6335,"in the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people .",positive
6336,"in itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie .",positive
6337,"where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people .",positive
6338,i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture .,positive
6339,"however , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film .",positive
6340,i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it .,positive
6341,"the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled `where the money is . '",positive
6342,"the elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught .",positive
6343,he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune .,positive
6344,"always the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail .",positive
6345,this involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis .,positive
6346,"when he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke .",positive
6347,"now a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home .",positive
6348,carol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him .,positive
6349,she's a very bright person with a good heart .,positive
6350,"yet , her life is a miserable waste of time .",positive
6351,the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars .,positive
6352,her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics .,positive
6353,"worse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) .",positive
6354,they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom .,positive
6355,"to her , this made sense long ago .",positive
6356,"but now , it's a different story .",positive
6357,"wayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put .",positive
6358,wayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman .,positive
6359,"carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life .",positive
6360,"however , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change .",positive
6361,the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke .,positive
6362,"carol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all .",positive
6363,"maybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away .",positive
6364,the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . ',positive
6365,and what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ?,positive
6366,perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses .,positive
6367,"if that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below .",positive
6368,"when he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining .",positive
6369,carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness .,positive
6370,she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy .,positive
6371,"this , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation .",positive
6372,henry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car .,positive
6373,henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash .,positive
6374,"meanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life .",positive
6375,"wayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless .",positive
6376,"however , his lack of commitment threatens their success .",positive
6377,"the heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong .",positive
6378,`where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist .,positive
6379,"newman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff .",positive
6380,"he possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive .",positive
6381,fiorentino is also a fun presence .,positive
6382,you root for her despite her sense of amorality .,positive
6383,"sure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic .",positive
6384,"with two charismatic characters such as these , it's hard to ignore that `where the money is' is where the fun is .",positive
6385,"robert benton has assembled a stellar , mature cast for his latest feature , twilight , a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood .",positive
6386,paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross .,positive
6387,"harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon ) , a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight .",positive
6388,"when jack sends him on a routine delivery job , however , the old instincts kick in .",positive
6389,"soon , harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line , and he no longer knows who to trust .",positive
6390,"there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight , in addition to newman , hackman and sarandon .",positive
6391,"james garner plays raymond hope , a former cop and one of harry's best friends .",positive
6392,"stockard channing plays verna , harry's former partner , and possibly a former love interest .",positive
6393,"reese witherspoon is mel , the distrustful daughter of the ames' , and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend .",positive
6394,"giancarlo esposito appears as harry's bumbling detective protigi , and john spencer is a suspicious police captain .",positive
6395,"with a cast like that , it's almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze .",positive
6396,"luckily , there's more to the film than some sort of actor's recognition ceremony .",positive
6397,twilight has a solid film noir-ish plot .,positive
6398,"it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics , but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days .",positive
6399,"the major cast members all deliver strong performances , as can be expected of their caliber .",positive
6400,"however , none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable .",positive
6401,"the supporting cast is enjoyable , if a little underdrawn .",positive
6402,"stockard channing's character , in particular , is a cipher .",positive
6403,there's more to her character than the film takes the time to describe .,positive
6404,"it's a minor , but irritating , flaw .",positive
6405,"with a solid cast , and a good plot , there's a lot to recommend about twilight .",positive
6406,it's biggest flaw is actually its short running time .,positive
6407,"at a slim 94 minutes , there's a lot of stuff that's packed into an awfully small package .",positive
6408,"still , the chance to see newman , sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two .",positive
6409,"warning : anyone offended by blatant , leering machismo had better avoid this film .",positive
6410,"or lots of blood & guts , men against men and mano-et-mano stuff .",positive
6411,"in other words , it's a walter hill film !",positive
6412,with a john milius script !,positive
6413,i always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between arm-wrestling matches .,positive
6414,"these films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with , probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb .",positive
6415,"and we got tough guys galore , here ; drug-running banditos by the dozens , all dirty and sweaty and pretty ill-tempered , overall ; a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to cover-up ( supposedly ) any connection between the government and the drug runners ; and lots of shit-kicking texas dirt farmers who'd as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you .",positive
6416,"in particular , we got nick nolte as one hard-ass texas ranger , powers boothe as the drug kingpin , michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army , and rip torn as the local sheriff .",positive
6417,torn is the sympathetic figure of the group ; he smiles before shooting anyone .,positive
6418,as to women . . .,positive
6419,"well , i've never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film , and at this rate , i doubt i ever will .",positive
6420,"women exist here to look good , comfort the man , and get argued over .",positive
6421,gosh !,positive
6422,just like the old days . . .,positive
6423,"frankly , this is a pretty good movie , if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff .",positive
6424,"the cinematography is excellent , the cast of characters is broad and has texture , the script is quite good , and the film lets you keep up with what's happening yourself , without spelling it out to you .",positive
6425,i appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up .,positive
6426,"finally , there's lots of sam peckinpah slow-motion shoot-ups .",positive
6427,"accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over .",positive
6428,one could almost say the same about his much-prized film .,positive
6429,"rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth .",positive
6430,"in short , the antithesis of all things hollywood .",positive
6431,yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind .,positive
6432,"ralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film .",positive
6433,"but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him .",positive
6434,his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld .,positive
6435,"the same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many .",positive
6436,juliette binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart .,positive
6437,"at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger .",positive
6438,"even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical .",positive
6439,"with so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film's 160 minutes can be taxing .",positive
6440,yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn't help but feel that greatness was in the air .,positive
6441,hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war .,positive
6442,there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years .,positive
6443,but ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed .,positive
6444,"in the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore .",positive
6445,bore is perhaps too strong a word .,positive
6446,"but after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full .",positive
6447,"a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates , a film which was based on the best-seller by george v . , higgins .",positive
6448,"it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie "" fingers "" coyle ( mitchum ) .",positive
6449,he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment .,positive
6450,"his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire , something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn't think he could survive prison at his age .",positive
6451,he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare .,positive
6452,"he could have cut a deal and gotten off , if he turned his boss over to the d . a . , but he figured he would never live if he did that .",positive
6453,he is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) .,positive
6454,the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager's house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it .,positive
6455,"on one of the heists , they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm .",positive
6456,"coyle's best friend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender .",positive
6457,"he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents , as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record , as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs .",positive
6458,"with the sentencing date closing in on him , the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time .",positive
6459,he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain .,positive
6460,"thinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire , he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down , knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence .",positive
6461,"but foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer , that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence , they want him to be a full-time informer .",positive
6462,warning : spoiler follows in next paragraph .,positive
6463,the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend .,positive
6464,the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up .,positive
6465,"coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , "" to be young like that and have his future , he's the greatest hockey player in the world . """,positive
6466,"dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style , having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston .",positive
6467,"this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets , of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in , and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next .",positive
6468,"the city streets are ugly , the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , whether it is betrayal or murder .",positive
6469,"there is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat .",positive
6470,"mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot .",positive
6471,it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them .,positive
6472,"mitchum is a loser ; and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor .",positive
6473,"but in the end , he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy , as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle .",positive
6474,""" footloose "" has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics .",positive
6475,and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it .,positive
6476,"the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) .",positive
6477,he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do .,positive
6478,"as mentioned at the beginning of this review , "" footloose "" is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama .",positive
6479,"there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate .",positive
6480,so why did i enjoy it so much ?,positive
6481,"for one thing , the cast is great .",positive
6482,kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role .,positive
6483,"we're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the "" rebel without a clue "" sort .",positive
6484,"yes , he does rebel , but he's also polite when he needs to be .",positive
6485,and he never broods .,positive
6486,the rest of the cast is equally impressive .,positive
6487,"john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian .",positive
6488,but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter .,positive
6489,"by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character .",positive
6490,another nice touch is the music .,positive
6491,"we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with "" sexual innuendos "" , but that's not true at all .",positive
6492,"the title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun .",positive
6493,"during the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing .",positive
6494,"of course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic .",positive
6495,"anyway , "" footloose "" is a charming little surprise .",positive
6496,don't let the premise prevent you from watching it .,positive
6497,"it sucked me in , and it'll do the same to you .",positive
6498,"as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film .",positive
6499,"with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a "" great "" piece of work and viceversa .",positive
6500,attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs .,positive
6501,i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology .,positive
6502,"as the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master .",positive
6503,as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality .,positive
6504,"crouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category .",positive
6505,"crouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology .",positive
6506,"it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable .",positive
6507,"all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement .",positive
6508,"the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two .",positive
6509,"it is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend .",positive
6510,the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented .,positive
6511,the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively .,positive
6512,"the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake .",positive
6513,there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry .,positive
6514,"as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy .",positive
6515,"do not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed .",positive
6516,"for those who are put off by the "" art "" label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance .",positive
6517,there are no weak performances in this movie .,positive
6518,"michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth , humanity and wisdom .",positive
6519,chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart .,positive
6520,zhang ziyi is a budding superstar .,positive
6521,she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role .,positive
6522,cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably .,positive
6523,"kudos to screenwriters james schamus , wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing , choreographer yuen wo-ping , photography director peter pau and music director tan dun , each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film .",positive
6524,"ang lee as the director , co-producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit .",positive
6525,"this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes , including those who hate martial arts movies .",positive
6526,don't miss it .,positive
6527,""" crazy/beautiful "" suffers from the damned-if-you-do , damned-if-you-don't syndrome .",positive
6528,"after a spate of flighty , cookie-cutter teen films , the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story .",positive
6529,"but rather than applaud the production , early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown "" afterschool special . """,positive
6530,"even worse , in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people , the studio got a case of the heebie-jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re-shoot scenes and cut footage to "" tone things down . """,positive
6531,"needless to say , the filmmaker was frustrated .",positive
6532,""" we were trying to make a cautionary tale , "" he told newsweek , "" and we couldn't show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from . """,positive
6533,"regardless , the film works , thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes .",positive

6537,"an honor student and star athlete , carlos is responsible , modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy .",positive
6538,"all is well until he meets nicole oakley ( kirsten dunst ) , the daughter of a rich congressman ( bruce davison ) .",positive
6539,nicole is a drunk apparently hell-bent on self-destruction .,positive
6540,"carlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her , but he is only human and she has the greatest smile .",positive
6541,"plus , as her father notes , she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral .",positive
6542,"as with "" save the last dance , "" "" crazy/beautiful "" ( god , how i hate lower-case titles ) takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh .",positive
6543,"while noting the racial and social differences between the kids , the screenplay dances around most of the clich ? s ( there are still several mtv moments , though ) .",positive
6544,the filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there .,positive
6545,cute-as-a-button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicole's behavior .,positive
6546,"she is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down , i hoped the boy would listen .",positive
6547,"as carlos , hernandez is a revelation .",positive
6548,"hunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team , the young man can really act ; we will see a lot of this guy in the future .",positive
6549,"aside from its title , the biggest problem with "" crazy/beautiful "" is its ending , which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy .",positive
6550,"after carefully presenting credible characters and situations , the conclusion feels rushed and lazy .",positive

6554,"giles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis .",positive
6555,"his house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he's living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth .",positive
6556,"this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns "" erstwhile fogy "" giles into a three-dimensional human being .",positive
6557,"despite his tunnel vision , it's impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love .",positive
6558,"and , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture , it's possible to find the object of one's affection in the most unusual places .",positive
6559,"giles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema , but when he learns that an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go .",positive
6560,what he doesn't realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii .,positive
6561,a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress .,positive
6562,"just as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it's love at first sight .",positive
6563,"giles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes .",positive
6564,"( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially doesn't realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr . )",positive
6565,"eventually , not satisfied with being the world's foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol's home is located .",positive
6566,"bostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie's supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) .",positive
6567,"eventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man's advice .",positive
6568,"but , while giles' affection runs deep , ronnie's feelings are less constant .",positive
6569,"love and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that .",positive
6570,"in fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect .",positive
6571,"it suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it .",positive
6572,"in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target .",positive
6573,"in the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited .",positive
6574,"from start to finish , this is clearly hurt's movie ? he's in almost every frame .",positive
6575,"it's a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions .",positive
6576,"jason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie .",positive
6577,"he is charismatic , and it's not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie .",positive
6578,"meanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin .",positive
6579,"love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a "" fish out of water "" tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) .",positive
6580,"yet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots .",positive

6608,"as the weekend progresses , they are both forced to fully engage life .",positive

6621,the chemistry between the two of them is non-existent which makes some of the ending unconvincing .,positive
6622,"katie holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor , but her character goes nowhere .",positive
6623,we never even see grady's exiting wife .,positive
6624,this is very much a guy's film .,positive
6625,the varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others .,positive
6626,"grady's alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film , not him and sara .",positive

6641,"besides eternal damnation , of course .",positive
6642,there is also a sub-plot about forlani's ex-boyfriend ( she dumps him for pitt ) trying to take over hopkins company .,positive
6643,""" meet joe black "" runs just under three hours .",positive
6644,i've always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics .,positive
6645,""" meet joe black "" is neither historical nor is it an epic , though i get the feeling martin brest ( the director ) desperately wants it to be .",positive
6646,every single scene in the movie goes on about 3-4 minutes too long .,positive

6648,"a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent , instead of just good , which is what it is .",positive
6649,"pitt , an actor i normally loathe , is actually quite engaging as death .",positive
6650,"i believed his performance , and i could see why forlani's character would fall in love with him .",positive
6651,"i have to agree with roger ebert , though , who found it hard to believe that an entity that's been around for all time wouldn't know what peanut butter was .",positive
6652,"that has nothing to do with pitt's performance , of course , but it is a little distracting .",positive
6653,hopkins gives his usual excellent performance .,positive
6654,"he's able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left , without making him an obnoxious whiner .",positive
6655,"and in her first major studio role , claire forlani is surprisingly good .",positive
6656,she has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her .,positive
6657,"so , "" meet joe black "" is a good movie hampered by it's ridiculous running time .",positive

6662,"in fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out .",positive
6663,( remember bob ? ),positive
6664,"the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it's consistently interesting , it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope .",positive
6665,"a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice .",positive
6666,"now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , "" what goes around really goes around . """,positive

6668,"minutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead .",positive
6669,"but for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn't a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel .",positive
6670,"and , with reese's death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will .",positive
6671,"only hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they're up against .",positive
6672,"the rest of the cops , including hobbes' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don't have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger .",positive
6673,"as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one .",positive
6674,no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown .,positive
6675,the most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ; it's geno's steaks .,positive
6676,shadows and night scenes abound .,positive
6677,the days are cloudy and unpromising .,positive
6678,this is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men .,positive
6679,"fallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized .",positive
6680,"somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise .",positive
6681,"but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check .",positive
6682,"nevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks .",positive
6683,the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual .,positive
6684,"of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance .",positive
6685,"john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick .",positive
6686,"sadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel .",positive
6687,"everyone else , including denzel washington , is boring .",positive
6688,washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film .,positive
6689,"it's not that he's bad per se , but he's not very interesting .",positive
6690,"there's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes .",positive
6691,"as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was .",positive
6692,washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency .,positive
6693,"however , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler's list ) and donald sutherland .",positive
6694,"to be fair , the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written .",positive
6695,"that said , however , there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work .",positive
6696,"both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual .",positive
6697,"narratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses .",positive
6698,"although the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters .",positive
6699,"at times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like "" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself "" become a little hard to swallow .",positive
6700,"in addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel .",positive
6701,"however , despite the negatives , i'm still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved .",positive
6702,"the final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected .",positive
6703,it's not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did .,positive
6704,"at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself .",positive
6705,"this is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it's a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours .",positive
6706,"and , whatever you do , don't walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll .",positive
6707,"james l . brooks , one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news , returns to the big screen with this entertaining , if slightly flawed comedy .",positive
6708,"nicholson plays melvin udall , probably the most horrible person ever on the screen .",positive
6709,"he's racist , homophobic , and never has a good word to say to anyone .",positive
6710,"so , nobody talks to him , except waitress carol conelly ( t . v",positive
6711,"sitcom star hunt , who was last seen in twister , 1996 ) .",positive
6712,"naturally , udall , conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates , all hit it off in the end .",positive
6713,"like good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 ) , even though the outcome is completely obvious , as good as it gets is an enjoyable , funny and warm comedy .",positive
6714,"nicholson is hilarious as melvin , churning out insults with superb relish .",positive
6715,only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers .,positive
6716,"hunt is also good as waitress carol , and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson .",positive
6717,there's also ( thankfully ) a bit of chemistry between them .,positive
6718,"kinnear , as the gay neighbor , seems to have a slightly underwritten role , he's more of a plot convience than a character .",positive
6719,"although his performance is good , his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together .",positive
6720,"in fact , the scene stealer is simon's dog , who is funnier than nicholson .",positive
6721,"but then again , pets are always cute on screen .",positive
6722,"providing solid support is cuba gooding , jnr ( jerry maguire , 1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isn't as good as is character in maguire , he is still fun .",positive
6723,"he overacts a little , but not so much as to be annoying .",positive
6724,"smith is also good , although she has a fairly small role .",positive
6725,"even director lawrence kasdan ( body heat , 1981 ) makes an appearance as a doctor .",positive
6726,"but this is primarily nicholsons film , and every scene he's in , he's steals it .",positive
6727,"he's character is so hateful , though , it's amazing that anyone talks to him at all , especially carol .",positive
6728,and this is the films main problem .,positive
6729,it's totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin .,positive
6730,"she doesn't fall in love with him naturally , the film forces her to fall in love with him .",positive
6731,"also , melvins character seems to go too nice , too quickly .",positive
6732,"i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice , loving person .",positive
6733,"it would take a helluva long time , much longer than this film would like to make out .",positive
6734,"brooks direction is good , though , if a bit average , but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience .",positive
6735,he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but generally he's good .,positive
6736,there's also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer .,positive
6737,"but , generally , as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do , which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie .",positive
6738,"the movie is a bit overlong , but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly .",positive
6739,"overall , as good as it gets is a fun movie , even though it may be unbelivable , and certainly worth seeing ( if just for jack nicholsons performance . )",positive
6740,"not quite as good as it gets ( pardon the bad joke ) , but still good fun .",positive
6741,after a stylistic detour with mrs .,positive
6742,"parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption .",positive
6743,"while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie .",positive
6744,it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it .,positive
6745,until mrs .,positive
6746,"parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies .",positive
6747,"i found equinox , his last pre- mrs .",positive
6748,"parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating .",positive
6749,"i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow .",positive
6750,"there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach .",positive
6751,"the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch .",positive
6752,"in short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in .",positive
6753,afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples .,positive
6754,"jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) .",positive
6755,"for her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level .",positive
6756,all she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating .,positive
6757,"after he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor .",positive
6758,"the other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne .",positive
6759,a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart .,positive
6760,"they remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs .",positive
6761,the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable .,positive
6762,the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey .,positive
6763,"the two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool .",positive
6764,"meanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains .",positive
6765,the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love .,positive
6766,"sex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness .",positive
6767,"ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves .",positive
6768,"the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances .",positive
6769,"jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman .",positive
6770,those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity .,positive
6771,"lara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability .",positive
6772,"nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease .",positive
6773,"the clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis .",positive
6774,"her often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars .",positive
6775,"i don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions .",positive
6776,"enough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters .",positive
6777,afterglow is basically a four-pronged character study .,positive
6778,"the plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture .",positive
6779,rudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction .,positive
6780,""" the fugitive "" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made .",positive
6781,"it takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that's totally believable throughout .",positive
6782,"this isn't an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly .",positive
6783,"harrison ford stars as dr . richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife .",positive
6784,"the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner .",positive
6785,we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble's perspective .,positive
6786,"hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble's wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered .",positive
6787,we don't get to see who the killer is until much further into the story .,positive
6788,"in fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble's innocence ourselves .",positive
6789,the film doesn't spend much time on the details of kimble's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story .,positive
6790,one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck .,positive
6791,"but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch .",positive
6792,this movie is so incredible because it's able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable .,positive
6793,"tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u . s . marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives .",positive
6794,from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur .,positive
6795,kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other .,positive
6796,most of the film deals with richard's complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife .,positive
6797,"ford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy's script and davis's outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is .",positive
6798,"just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work is very interesting .",positive
6799,"we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we .",positive
6800,meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down .,positive
6801,"at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them .",positive
6802,he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery .,positive
6803,one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor .,positive
6804,there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) .,positive
6805,"they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one-liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner .",positive
6806,the final act concludes with another terrific chase .,positive
6807,"richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him , and although we get a typical fight scene , the case is far from solved .",positive
6808,"the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along , and we don't realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together .",positive
6809,"maybe the finally scene is a bit much , but it still has a believable atmosphere to it .",positive
6810,we're so relieved when justice is served .,positive
6811,"it's not the plot is that makes "" the fugitive "" great , it's all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story .",positive
6812,watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous .,positive
6813,if only hollywood could produce more movies like this .,positive
6814,"( 10/31/96 ) ( 1/29/97 ) ( 6/13/97 ) [see also : "" nick of time "" ]",positive
6815,i think that any competent member of the human race who's ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer .,positive
6816,"even though i try very hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen .",positive
6817,but i don't care .,positive
6818,not even a little .,positive
6819,my reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great .,positive
6820,2 ) drew barrymore is great .,positive
6821,3 ) the movie is so funny .,positive
6822,there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard .,positive
6823,i haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers .,positive
6824,"sandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music .",positive
6825,"in the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness .",positive
6826,"a week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone ) .",positive
6827,"with his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress .",positive
6828,"she is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months .",positive
6829,julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans .,positive
6830,"soon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other .",positive
6831,"oh sure , it's trite .",positive
6832,"and if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience .",positive
6833,"what makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances .",positive
6834,barrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) .,positive
6835,"not only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written .",positive
6836,"and the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i've ever seen .",positive
6837,"naturally , the true star here is sandler .",positive
6838,i think the guy is flat-out hilarious .,positive
6839,"he can say something that just isn't funny , and his delivery makes me laugh .",positive
6840,"his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy .",positive
6841,"whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into .",positive
6842,"as far as i'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents .",positive
6843,and the movie is just so funny .,positive
6844,perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him .,positive
6845,this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air .,positive
6846,"and while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half .",positive
6847,my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important .,positive
6848,"the film is predicable , but who cares ?",positive
6849,"the characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable .",positive
6850,"in addition to this , i can't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film .",positive
6851,"in that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review .",positive
6852,i just want everyone to know that i laughed .,positive
6853,a lot .,positive
6854,"based on the boris karloff's classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed . . . all while still alive .",positive
6855,"recap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy .",positive
6856,"problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . .",positive
6857,"walking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good .",positive
6858,"the visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all .",positive
6859,"they pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi .",positive
6860,"the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) .",positive
6861,"unfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres .",positive
6862,"on one hand , it is a fast paced action film .",positive
6863,"on the other , it's a frightening horror film .",positive
6864,"and on the side , it's a hilarious comedy .",positive
6865,"ideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) .",positive
6866,"the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner .",positive
6867,"if they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep's entombment , that would be impossible .",positive
6868,and then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies .,positive
6869,"while really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy .",positive
6870,replace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness .,positive
6871,"while entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place .",positive
6872,but at least it's a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of .,positive
6873,"on the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience .",positive
6874,but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn,positive
6875,the sound down !,positive
6876,"while a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you're not careful ) .",positive
6877,"when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , "" end of days "" , it was so loud i couldn't make anything out .",positive
6878,"on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with .",positive
6879,"in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his "" giallo "" murder mysteries .",positive
6880,"while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller .",positive
6881,"the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book "" tenebrae "" .",positive
6882,"with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems .",positive
6883,the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa .,positive
6884,"he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him .",positive
6885,the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension .,positive
6886,"argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business .",positive
6887,tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here .,positive
6888,it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play .,positive
6889,in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes .,positive
6890,"needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist .",positive
6891,many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork .,positive
6892,"they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria .",positive
6893,"instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world .",positive
6894,and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment .,positive
6895,"so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question .",positive
6896,"still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative .",positive
6897,"some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated .",positive
6898,"by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs .",positive
6899,"about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious .",positive
6900,"we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal .",positive
6901,"he is insane , apparently .",positive
6902,the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife .,positive
6903,"he is finally revealed to us as this "" second killer "" in the film's bloody climax .",positive
6904,"but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively .",positive
6905,"you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house .",positive
6906,"but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway .",positive
6907,bad cutting puts the timing way out .,positive
6908,"in other words , he's almost in two places at once .",positive
6909,during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring .,positive
6910,by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant .,positive
6911,the injury ?,positive
6912,he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock !,positive
6913,"thus , the revelation of the "" hero "" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled .",positive
6914,"helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along .",positive
6915,"but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least .",positive
6916,"the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage .",positive
6917,tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies .,positive
6918,"for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike .",positive
6919,"we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too !",positive
6920,"that's careless filmmaking , pure and simple .",positive
6921,"why , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ?",positive
6922,"because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world .",positive
6923,take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae .,positive
6924,an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town .,positive
6925,"finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair .",positive
6926,"it's an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone .",positive
6927,and that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating .,positive
6928,"too often , it seems , argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts .",positive
6929,"mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look .",positive
6930,and if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential .,positive
6931,see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli .,positive
6932,"it's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative .",positive
6933,"a shame , because it doesn't have to be that way .",positive
6934,"take argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache .",positive
6935,"proof that he can do it , if he tries . . .",positive
6936,"as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult .",positive
6937,parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives .,positive
6938,"but if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome .",positive
6939,`affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood .,positive
6940,the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) .,positive
6941,here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface .,positive
6942,he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me .,positive
6943,"but as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head .",positive
6944,we see that he is a mean-tempered person .,positive
6945,"he has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him .",positive
6946,"he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence .",positive
6947,he also has tremendous problems with relationships .,positive
6948,he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter .,positive
6949,but his bearish persona and stature alienates her .,positive
6950,he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him .,positive
6951,his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk .,positive
6952,"she tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point .",positive
6953,"finally , he is spiteful and vindictive .",positive
6954,"as a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless .",positive
6955,"as the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died .",positive
6956,we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain .,positive
6957,he is a prisoner and a slave to it .,positive
6958,he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension .,positive
6959,what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ?,positive
6960,we learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) .,positive
6961,this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet .,positive
6962,he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist .,positive
6963,we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks .,positive
6964,"to heighten the father's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person .",positive
6965,very effective .,positive
6966,"today , wade's dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man .",positive
6967,"the influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade .",positive
6968,the result is every son's nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be .,positive
6969,"this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama , and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity .",positive
6970,he's a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father .,positive
6971,coburn displays heft as the bitter dad .,positive
6972,"but , it's most certainly not saturday-night-friendly fare .",positive
6973,there's nothing light or fluffy about this film .,positive
6974,that may turn many moviegoers away .,positive
6975,but it's certainly worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing nolte's and coburn's raw acting talents .,positive
6976,is evil dead ii a bad movie ?,positive
6977,"it's full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release .",positive
6978,explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult .,positive
6979,`well what's it about ? ',positive
6980,"`five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly , hairy , wart covered monsters . '",positive
6981,`come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week .,positive
6982,why should i see it again ? ',positive
6983,"`no evil dead ii is different , it's funny . '",positive
6984,`it's funny to see people die ?,positive
6985,are you sick or something ? ',positive
6986,maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie .,positive
6987,"his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious .",positive
6988,an example of raimi's odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash's girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound .,positive
6989,"sure it's over-the-top , but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet .",positive
6990,"the whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster .",positive
6991,"the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , the more amusing it becomes .",positive
6992,"no matter how sick it may sound , it is funny to watch bruce ampbell's ash get his butt kicked every five minutes .",positive
6993,"and raimi takes advantage , he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend , by the body of an old lady , even by his own right hand .",positive
6994,"like the less superior idle hands , we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part .",positive
6995,"but it doesn't end , ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family .",positive
6996,"all of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny .",positive
6997,"raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off .",positive
6998,"with a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares .",positive
6999,"ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series , raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn't wait to make it's sequel .",positive
7000,"it's rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year , but that is what disney and pixar animation ; s latest film represents .",positive
7001,"while a bugs life isn't nearly as deep as it's predecessor , dreamwork's antz , it is just as funny .",positive
7002,"a bug's life centers , appropriately , around the life of an ant , named flik .",positive
7003,"flik , cutely voiced by newsradio's david foley , hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task .",positive
7004,"when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost , the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way .",positive
7005,the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them .,positive
7006,"the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper , who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey .",positive
7007,when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food .,positive
7008,"when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission , they never dream he will be successful , they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food .",positive
7009,flik's mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return .,positive
7010,"instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs , who he mistakenly assumes are warriors .",positive
7011,"when he returns with the `warriors' , the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes .",positive
7012,a bug's life has animation that is simply stunning .,positive
7013,the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative .,positive
7014,"together with the great voice acting , this film is the perfect holiday family film .",positive
7015,"its main weakness is that it couldn't beat antz to the theaters , making it seem like stale material .",positive
7016,"not since oliver stone's natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility .",positive
7017,"while fincher's films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997's the game ) into something like a definitive statement .",positive
7018,"jack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia .",positive
7019,"on the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer .",positive
7020,"here he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia .",positive
7021,"strangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob's breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy "" tourist "" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity .",positive
7022,"later , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life .",positive
7023,"one night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don't ask-- you'll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn't feel good .",positive
7024,"it is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison .",positive
7025,"he moves into tyler's squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are "" don't talk about fight club . """,positive
7026,"armed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees .",positive
7027,"resentment creeps into jack's heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla .",positive
7028,"funded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem .",positive
7029,"their initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour .",positive
7030,"it is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist .",positive
7031,it is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting .,positive
7032,"it's a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out .",positive
7033,fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people .,positive
7034,"in the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it .",positive
7035,"i'll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don't spring up here and there , and i'll be even more amazed if fincher isn't vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone .",positive
7036,"they needn't bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher's elaborate attempt at a joke .",positive
7037,"tyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization .",positive
7038,"in this context , the joke works , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others won't .",positive
7039,"hopefully , though , their silly moral outrage won't spoil the joke for the rest of us .",positive
7040,plot : a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention .,positive
7041,"the boys eventually get together to split the money , but as plans change , double-crosses occur , dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road .",positive
7042,"who's on the up and up , who's the real bad guy and who's gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie .",positive
7043,critique : the funnest movie that i've seen so far this year !,positive
7044,"it's got style , it's got tough guys talkin' shite and it's got plenty of bullets to go around .",positive
7045,a definite hunk-a-hunk-a burnin' adventure !,positive
7046,"a guy's guy movie through and through , and one that'll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff .",positive
7047,"it's not very original , it goes on for a little too long , but costner and russell make it happen , as two shite-kickin' elvis lovers , who don't stop till they , more or less , drop .",positive
7048,"this movie's got some pretty intensive shoot-out scenes , one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i've ever witnessed , featuring several elvises with guns a blazin' and the king's music playing in the background , and a decent helping of double-crosses , sharp dialogue and funny moments .",positive
7049,"in fact , even though the cast is filled with many name actors ( b-actors as they might be for the most part ) , most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim .",positive
7050,"but the true glue that holds this film together , other than the spirit of elvis himself , is costner and russell , who play their badass characters to the t . sure , russell's been down this road before , but costner surprised me with his nastiness .",positive
7051,"i guess he's pissed at all the box-office bombs that he's been in of late , but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here .",positive
7052,"in the end , the bottom line with this movie is having fun , kickin' ass and making sure there's enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards .",positive
7053,"and smoke 'em if you got 'em , folks !",positive
7054,"there is also this one really great show-down scene between costner and a cop , that'll have you crackin' up and lovin' it all at the same time .",positive
7055,the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that'll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next .,positive
7056,"it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background , with plenty , and i mean plenty , of camera tricks , cuts and edits , but for this kind of flick , it actually works .",positive
7057,"the film is not perfect though , it starts off with a pretty big bang , but then pulls a way of the gun on us , and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle , while characters intermingle and disperse .",positive
7058,"i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots , and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well .",positive
7059,and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega-hot in the movie ?,positive
7060,"no . . . okay ,",positive
7061,well i just did !,positive
7062,"i coulda done without her whole "" romance "" angle , but to be honest , it doesn't take up much of the film , which is generally covered in blood , explosions , guts and elvis nods .",positive
7063,"try to see how many "" inside "" connections to the king you can guess .",positive
7064,"of course , it's no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind .",positive
7065,"i also like these types of "" guy "" movies a lot , and even though the film doesn't bring much originality to the table , it does offer a pretty coherent story , some nice twists and turns , humor and a big ol' helping of whoop-ass coming straight from costner and russell's respective boots .",positive
7066,"probably not a film for everyone , but definitely for those who enjoy the guns , the charismatic bad guys and a fun , if entirely disposable , adventure .",positive
7067,now see how many elvis songs i've used to pun my way through this phony review below .,positive
7068,the elvis songs also recommend this movie !,positive
7069,"so whether you're lonesome tonight or any other night , remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets , leave your little sister at home , bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse , cause this movie ain't one to return to the sender .",positive
7070,"i really beg of you , whether you're stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel , to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender .",positive
7071,"and no suspicious minds either , folks , cause i got stung by this movie , i mean it really shook me up , and unless you're the devil in disguise himself , i think you won't be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either .",positive
7072,"so don't be cruel , don't turn away , don't curl up with your latest flame tonite ( whether she be a hard-headed woman or not ) and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film .",positive
7073,"it's now or never , folks .",positive
7074,"trust me , i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i'd seen so far this year is far behind me .",positive
7075,joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building .,positive
7076,thank you . . . thank,positive
7077,you very much ! !,positive
7078,where's joblo coming from ?,positive
7079,get carter ( 7/10 ) - heat ( 8/10 ) - honeymoon in vegas ( 9/10 ) - payback ( 8/10 ) - reindeer games ( 5/10 ) -reservoir dogs ( 9/10 ) - way of the gun ( 6/10 ),positive
7080,">from the commercials , this looks like a mild-mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight .",positive
7081,instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end .,positive
7082,the concept is deceptively pedestrian .,positive
7083,an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way .,positive
7084,the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea .,positive
7085,the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents .,positive
7086,"following one dead end lead after another , each funnier than the previous , they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents : alan alda and lily tomlin .",positive
7087,it's difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot .,positive
7088,seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one .,positive
7089,"without giving too much away , one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol , tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi-sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion .",positive
7090,"and it's all done in a fairly clean , almost ( well , maybe not exactly ) family fare manner .",positive
7091,"a grand cast ( tomlin , alda , moore , ben stiller , patricia arquette , tea leoni , george segal ) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs .",positive
7092,"drawing from a more hyper woody allen style , the film succeeds beyond expectations .",positive
7093,i'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review .,positive
7094,"i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson's political satire "" wag the dog , "" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it .",positive
7095,"quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn't do that .",positive
7096,"they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn't quite do that either .",positive
7097,"a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick's "" dr .",positive
7098,"strangelove "" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn't do that .",positive
7099,"that said , "" wag the dog "" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them .",positive
7100,"the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office .",positive
7101,"the accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn't particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president's campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood .",positive
7102,"brean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor .",positive
7103,"as i said , "" wag the dog "" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform "" we have the right to fight for democracy . """,positive
7104,"another scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village .",positive
7105,the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team's attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt .,positive
7106,"william "" old shoe "" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho .",positive
7107,"of course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what's going on and strikes a deal with the president's electoral opponent to report to the media that the "" fighting "" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis .",positive
7108,"still , even with the cia's involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable .",positive
7109,"regardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn't the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ?",positive
7110,"the film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt .",positive
7111,schumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it .,positive
7112,"there was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss's forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away .",positive
7113,"with these plot holes , "" wag the dog "" doesn't quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place .",positive
7114,"brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off .",positive
7115,"the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret .",positive
7116,"motss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project .",positive
7117,"in fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss's increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created .",positive
7118,"i think it's fair to say that "" wag the dog "" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire .",positive
7119,"still , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one .",positive
7120,"wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn't even real ?",positive
7121,"with this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws .",positive
7122,the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible .,positive
7123,"people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred .",positive
7124,"five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg's survivors of the shoah visual history foundation .",positive
7125,the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry .,positive
7126,"as the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe .",positive
7127,"in 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany's reach , and they became the last target of hitler's "" final solution . """,positive
7128,each of the five tells his or her story .,positive
7129,"their stories are intercut chronologically , starting from normal life in pre-war hungary .",positive
7130,"they recall the nazi invasion of hungary , being sent to "" work "" camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps .",positive
7131,"they recall their horrible , precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope .",positive
7132,"each recalls his or her unfathomable , eventual liberation .",positive
7133,"and finally , the last days shows their cathartic , pained , modern-day return to their old homes and the camps .",positive
7134,"needless to say , their stories are horrifying , amazing , and emotionally draining .",positive
7135,"by themselves , the stories would be forceful testaments , but by cutting them in parallel , their impact is multiplied by five .",positive
7136,"the last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- it's mostly pictures of people telling their stories , intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage .",positive
7137,"in this kind of movie it's almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects' narration .",positive
7138,the liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days .,positive
7139,it's not clear which scene it is .,positive
7140,"it could be one of two that i hadn't seen before , both powerful .",positive
7141,"one is rare color footage , shot by an american , of piles of victims in cattle cars .",positive
7142,"there is something jarring , something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color , when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white .",positive
7143,another segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore .,positive
7144,there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say .,positive
7145,"but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war , moll told a specific part of the story in a new way , in greater detail .",positive
7146,and i'm glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject .,positive
7147,the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful .,positive
7148,"x-mozilla-status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary , but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring , when skies are blue and trees are green .",positive
7149,"also , the movie was shot on 35mm film ( and not video ! ) ,",positive
7150,so the richness and detail are impeccable .,positive
7151,the dvd's features are plentiful and well-chosen .,positive
7152,"there is a theatrical trailer for the movie , which is a great introduction to the subject matter .",positive
7153,"there are about fifty still photos , both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors .",positive
7154,"also , the disc has two complete versions of the movie ( widescreen and full screen ) , both on the same side .",positive
7155,one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors ( plus one for the crew ) .,positive
7156,"you'd think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary , but they're not bloopers .",positive
7157,"instead , they are solid , moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length .",positive
7158,one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film .,positive
7159,"renee firestone ( one of the five ) spoke on camera with dr . hans m ? nch , a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz .",positive
7160,"firestone was aggressive , questioning the doctor about what his children thought .",positive
7161,the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable .,positive
7162,another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz .,positive
7163,"he ends his prayer by saying "" . . . forgive me for surviving . """,positive
7164,it's ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film .,positive
7165,"it's ambitious to make it on a subject that has saturated cable , television , and movies .",positive
7166,it's ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers .,positive
7167,but the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well .,positive
7168,"it's only fitting that the dvd , with its wealth of interesting and relevant features , would also be ambitious and successful .",positive
7169,it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child ? whether that may be in life or in death .,positive
7170,"after having said that , i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well .",positive
7171,"one gets that choking sensation in the throat ( because of grief ) when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake , or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement .",positive
7172,"there is no ocean , no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ? ordinary people' .",positive
7173,in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing ( not that this literally happened in the movie ) .,positive
7174,so what are the lessons learnt : 1 .,positive
7175,don't take your children to class reunions .,positive
7176,"2 . don't leave them alone in the lobby , not even for a second .",positive
7177,"michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly-strung wife and mother , a trend that started with ? a thousand acres' and ? one fine day' .",positive
7178,"my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie , so much so that when she has a nervous break down , the veins on her temples bulge impressively .",positive
7179,"whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance , playing a lesbian cop , with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop .",positive
7180,"lastly , who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie ? my grandmother comes to mind .",positive
7181,"i know that "" funnest "" isn't a word .",positive
7182,""" fun "" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective .",positive
7183,"but that's the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run . """,positive
7184,"no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like "" that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! """,positive
7185,"so to hell with webster's -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while .",positive
7186,i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner .,positive
7187,the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something .,positive
7188,"living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box .",positive
7189,"one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer .",positive
7190,"rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan .",positive
7191,"she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , "" chickens go in ; pies come out . """,positive
7192,what sort of pies ?,positive
7193,"chicken pies , of course .",positive
7194,"co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave . """,positive
7195,"the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures .",positive
7196,"part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new .",positive
7197,""" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories .",positive
7198,"but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived .",positive
7199,"now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run . """,positive
7200,"the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement .",positive
7201,"thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done .",positive
7202,part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ?,positive
7203,"park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is .",positive
7204,"but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us .",positive
7205,"another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing .",positive
7206,"there are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17 . """,positive
7207,"the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom . """,positive
7208,"there's even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history .",positive
7209,"the "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it .",positive
7210,"when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution .",positive
7211,"consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online .",positive
7212,"out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome .",positive
7213,why ?,positive
7214,"because once you got past the thought that "" they're parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose .",positive
7215,"they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing .",positive
7216,"conversely , "" chicken run "" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene .",positive
7217,"if you've never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun .",positive
7218,"even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character .",positive
7219,"park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either .",positive
7220,"enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer .",positive
7221,"the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them .",positive
7222,"ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it .",positive
7223,"she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer .",positive
7224,"the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet .",positive
7225,"poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help .",positive
7226,"jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence .",positive
7227,they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma .,positive
7228,"one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of "" chicken run , "" it comes as a delightful surprise .",positive
7229,"the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens .",positive
7230,the animation is first-rate .,positive
7231,"remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable "" chicken run "" really is .",positive
7232,this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail .,positive
7233,"as in such top-notch family fare as "" a bug's life "" or "" toy story 2 , "" "" chicken run "" has something to offer in nearly every frame .",positive
7234,"certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details .",positive
7235,"anyway , the movie's just a boatload of fun .",positive
7236,funnest damn movie i've seen all year .,positive
7237,capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg .,positive
7238,joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs .,positive
7239,it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure .,positive
7240,the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious .,positive
7241,i had a good time .,positive
7242,", low +2 ( -4 to +4 )",positive
7243,here goes my credibility .,positive
7244,this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority .,positive
7245,i liked the third jurassic park film .,positive
7246,i even liked the second jurassic park film .,positive
7247,"in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle .",positive
7248,"jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , "" for the boy who's half man or the man who's half boy . """,positive
7249,that is what all the jurassic park films are .,positive
7250,expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house .,positive
7251,the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also .,positive
7252,jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs .,positive
7253,"the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting .",positive
7254,some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds .,positive
7255,that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require .,positive
7256,i feel i got my money's worth .,positive
7257,the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica .,positive
7258,this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park .,positive
7259,"they hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island's dinosaurs from a safe height .",positive
7260,"the height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not .",positive
7261,the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended .,positive
7262,flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide .,positive
7263,he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs .,positive
7264,but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go .,positive
7265,doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs .,positive
7266,they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn .,positive
7267,he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once .,positive
7268,right .,positive
7269,guess what happens next ?,positive
7270,jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 .,positive
7271,first it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm .,positive
7272,"sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first .",positive
7273,curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance .,positive
7274,"one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time .",positive
7275,they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films .,positive
7276,"of course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species .",positive
7277,"not only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic .",positive
7278,"in this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition .",positive
7279,this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized .,positive
7280,"each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course .",positive
7281,"in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty .",positive
7282,it has a crocodile's head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright .,positive
7283,perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs .,positive
7284,sometimes they just move too fast to see .,positive
7285,occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision .,positive
7286,"a few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory .",positive
7287,but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films .,positive
7288,the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams's score for the first film .,positive
7289,"joe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky .",positive
7290,a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay .,positive
7291,"the film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun .",positive
7292,"if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you .",positive
7293,i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .,positive
7294,"just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) .",positive
7295,"either way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny .",positive
7296,why is this ?,positive
7297,"maybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional .",positive
7298,"director stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day .",positive
7299,"when watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again .",positive
7300,"i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends .",positive
7301,"i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time .",positive
7302,"and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around .",positive
7303,"rob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all .",positive
7304,"he uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman .",positive
7305,"and like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort .",positive
7306,he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it .,positive
7307,"whatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co .",positive
7308,grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives .,positive
7309,rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in .,positive
7310,"during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him .",positive
7311,but these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) .,positive
7312,the plot in three words is : women and music .,positive
7313,the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective .,positive
7314,"it gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle .",positive
7315,it also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is .,positive
7316,jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball .,positive
7317,"just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week .",positive
7318,what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes .,positive
7319,"john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob .",positive
7320,"now instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say .",positive
7321,the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended .,positive
7322,instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that .,positive
7323,also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie .,positive
7324,"high fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs .",positive
7325,"i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great .",positive
7326,plot : a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes .,positive
7327,"he is taken prisoner along with some other humans , and tries his best to escape his simian captors .",positive
7328,"oh yeah , and did i mention that the apes can talk ?",positive
7329,kewl !,positive
7330,"critique : despite this film not looking like a "" tim burton movie "" or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself , i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare .",positive
7331,although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations .,positive
7332,"i mean , i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real !",positive
7333,"i also have to "" give it up "" to all of the actors inside the costumes , not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours , but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well .",positive
7334,"i especially enjoyed bonham carter's performance , who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roth's bad guy , who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part .",positive
7335,"plot-wise , i liked the beginning of the film , the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village , the escape and most of the fight scenes , but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest .",positive
7336,"i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of "" human beings as animals "" then i was about the end battle sequence , which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film .",positive
7337,"i also hated the "" kid "" character who just got on my nerves and didn't really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved ( i won't ruin it here but c'mon guys . . . you",positive
7338,"coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that , no ? ) .",positive
7339,"but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character , his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter-species love interests .",positive
7340,this dude didn't seem to give a rat's ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn't really care about what happened to him either .,positive
7341,"now i'm not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script , but the film suffered because of it .",positive
7342,"visually , the movie was also nice to look at ( especially the apes ! ) , but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton .",positive
7343,"the "" surprise ending "" that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 , felt a little tacked on here , and despite being interesting , didn't really make all that much sense to me ( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view ) .",positive
7344,"so overall , i loved the whole "" feel "" of the planet , the apes that ruled it , the manner in which they treated the humans , screamed , shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain , but didn't appreciate the film's lack of human character development ( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie ? ) and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring .",positive
7345,"but i would still recommend this film as a fun , summer movie with laughs , creepiness and a really cool premise .",positive
7346,"ps : for anyone who has seen the original , i cannot believe that they didn't at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character ( in this case , mark wahlberg ) goes nuts at the world in which he's suddenly been thrust ( "" this is a mad house ! "" -",positive
7347,type of thing ) .,positive
7348,"the guy in this film barely seems to be "" put off "" by the fact that he's surrounded by apes who can speak english ! !",positive
7349,where's joblo coming from ?,positive
7350,the arrival ( 8/10 ) - battlefield earth ( 7/10 ) - godzilla ( 4/10 ) - instinct ( 6/10 ) - mission to mars ( 3/10 ) - pitch black ( 7/10 ) - ( 1968 ) planet of the apes ( 9/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 ),positive
7351,disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched .,positive
7352,"to see a disaster film with actual originality , or at least a decent plot twist , would definitely be a welcome surprise .",positive
7353,"unfortunately , folks , it's not likely .",positive
7354,"dante's peak is cliched , and at times corny , but also pretty decent .",positive
7355,"to be honest , i wasn't very interested in seeing this film , and word of mouth , as well as several reviews , didn't make it sound promising .",positive
7356,so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn't bad at all .,positive
7357,"it's pretty run of the mill , but it's not something i would say is merely "" ok "" to watch .",positive
7358,"in case you don't know , dante's peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it's shadow , dante's peak ( who would've guessed , eh ? ) .",positive
7359,"pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and , perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof , is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future .",positive
7360,"due to the lack of more substantial evidence , nobody warns the small town , and when they finally do , it's in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows .",positive
7361,"brosnan , all around good guy , will , of course , save the day .",positive
7362,.,positive
7363,.,positive
7364,or at least the mayor of dante's peak ( linda hamilton ) .,positive
7365,naturally the two will become infatuated with one another .,positive
7366,"( if you think i just ruined a plot development , you haven't seen very many movies ! )",positive
7367,there's also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings .,positive
7368,"and of course , the kids or the dog ( at least one or the other ) will do something heroic .",positive
7369,.,positive
7370,.,positive
7371,"but hey , i don't want to ruin all the surprises !",positive
7372,"if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante's peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time , i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself .",positive
7373,"it's not brain food , but it succeeds at what it's meant to be .",positive
7374,.,positive
7375,.,positive
7376,"an enjoyable , suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash !",positive
7377,in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers .,positive
7378,full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture .,positive
7379,go see it !,positive
7380,"so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on "" hard copy "" with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's .",positive
7381,""" hard copy "" 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for .",positive
7382,"smart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal .",positive
7383,( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . ),positive
7384,smart's got a point .,positive
7385,it wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version .,positive
7386,"however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later .",positive
7387,"real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman .",positive
7388,"to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb .",positive
7389,the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv . ',positive
7390,"of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon .",positive
7391,"but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily .",positive
7392,kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne .,positive
7393,i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture .,positive
7394,her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates .,positive
7395,"kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell .",positive
7396,"she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way .",positive
7397,at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law .,positive
7398,""" you know , "" she knowingly exclaims , "" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . """,positive
7399,her husband beams at suzanne's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters .,positive
7400,"this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks .",positive
7401,the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix .,positive
7402,"he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne's sexual favors .",positive
7403,"kidman's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland .",positive
7404,"phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) .",positive
7405,"his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere , ever .",positive
7406,"phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him .",positive
7407,"gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate .",positive
7408,he keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along .,positive
7409,van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn't stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions .,positive
7410,van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to 'get it' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story .,positive
7411,"the screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i've heard since heathers .",positive
7412,"henry's story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters .",positive
7413,henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic .,positive
7414,"danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands .",positive
7415,either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties .,positive

7423,"i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement .",positive
7424,"this was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm .",positive
7425,"then marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups .",positive
7426,"it certainly didn't look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his "" last night of freedom . """,positive
7427,"ben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this 'till death do you part business .",positive

7429,"as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he's never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she's never had .",positive
7430,"forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue .",positive
7431,"ben is an ideal role for affleck's easy-going charm , and he plays the straight-laced straight man without forced exasperation .",positive
7432,"sandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping .",positive
7433,"the two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script's apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely .",positive
7434,"lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification .",positive
7435,"the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution .",positive
7436,"forces of nature isn't about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it's about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it's not what he thought it was .",positive
7437,"lawrence's script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense .",positive
7438,"earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine .",positive
7439,"though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you'll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom .",positive
7440,"that is , provided you're not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes .",positive
7441,"for a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans .",positive
7442,"occasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can't find what's underneath .",positive
7443,"a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes' excesses can't spoil this unique concoction .",positive
7444,"forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents .",positive

7449,"-------------------- "" fail-safe "" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes",positive
7450,screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet,positive
7451,review by jamahl epsicokhan --------------------,positive
7452,the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side .,positive
7453,"in a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives .",positive
7454,the idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs .,positive
7455,"this is the theme of sidney lumet's "" fail-safe , "" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler .",positive
7456,""" fail-safe "" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism .",positive
7457,the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws .,positive
7458,five u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america .,positive
7459,"the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers .",positive
7460,"suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike .",positive
7461,"a great deal of "" fail-safe "" 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost .",positive
7462,"the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios .",positive
7463,the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails .,positive
7464,"general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable .",positive
7465,"the events in "" fail-safe "" are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason "" fail-safe "" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot .",positive
7466,"a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it .",positive
7467,"most of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war .",positive
7468,many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices .,positive
7469,"early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of "" strategy "" in a nuclear assault to "" minimize "" casualties .",positive
7470,""" what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? """,positive
7471,a guest asks impatiently .,positive
7472,""" forty million , "" groeteschele responds wryly .",positive
7473,the problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war .,positive
7474,the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals .,positive
7475,groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over .,positive
7476,"yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o'herlihy ) has often recommended .",positive
7477,"on the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage .",positive
7478,such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race .,positive
7479,""" fail-safe "" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film .",positive
7480,why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ?,positive
7481,is it wise ?,positive
7482,is it even logical ?,positive
7483,"no , not really .",positive
7484,"although "" fail-safe "" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way .",positive
7485,"again , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance .",positive
7486,"in addition to providing the central "" pro-nuclear war "" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism .",positive
7487,the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib .,positive
7488,"one of groeteschele's "" logical "" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely absurd .",positive
7489,"he labels the average marxist an "" unfeeling , calculating machine "" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself .",positive
7490,"groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia's home soil--which must be preserved at all costs .",positive
7491,groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would .,positive
7492,the irony here is groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing .,positive
7493,he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns .,positive
7494,"once the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be .",positive
7495,"just how will the soviet union's leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ?",positive
7496,( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ),positive
7497,"with the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet's long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader .",positive
7498,"without getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances .",positive
7499,"( that is , as sensible as a nuclear "" incident "" can probably be . )",positive
7500,"it does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn't possible because of its all-too-real consequences .",positive
7501,"dramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o'herlihy's character as the symbolic "" matador "" ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film's opening ) , is particularly appropriate .",positive
7502,""" fail-safe "" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film .",positive
7503,"nevertheless , under lumet's direction and walter bernstein's intelligent adaptation of burdick's and wheeler's novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded .",positive
7504,the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming .,positive
7505,"but it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that "" fail-safe "" also finds dangerous .",positive
7506,"in retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century .",positive
7507,"it's just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele's dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown .",positive
7508,"andrew lloyd webber's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time .",positive
7509,"webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as "" oklahoma ! , "" or the slapstickness of shows like "" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . """,positive
7510,"they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics .",positive
7511,"like "" jesus christ superstar , "" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune "" superstar , "" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn't spread his message wider ) , "" evita "" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) .",positive
7512,""" evita "" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn't like di slept to "" the top "" ) .",positive
7513,"webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it .",positive
7514,"here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad .",positive
7515,"it's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung .",positive
7516,"the film plays like a rock opera , much like their "" jesus christ superstar , "" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one .",positive
7517,"after all , this is a musical , and webber's musicals never undermine this .",positive
7518,"they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side .",positive
7519,"this is why the beginning of "" evita "" is kind of a let-down .",positive
7520,"okay , it is a let-down .",positive
7521,"i'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they're pretty good .",positive
7522,"but what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand .",positive
7523,"in the musical , it's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , "" buenos aires , "" which is also lifeless .",positive
7524,"then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , "" another suitcase in another hall , "" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva .",positive
7525,"the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it's being narrated by a hater of eva's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light .",positive
7526,"for a while , it looks like alan parker can't pull it off .",positive
7527,"however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song "" goodbye and thank you , "" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful .",positive
7528,"from this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical .",positive
7529,"no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact .",positive
7530,"we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) .",positive
7531,"more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work .",positive
7532,"juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory .",positive
7533,"a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before .",positive
7534,">from the "" goodbye and thank you "" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation's people downtrodden .",positive
7535,"but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star .",positive
7536,"that's when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn't the great woman she really was , and expose her fame .",positive
7537,"describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he's said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can't help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death .",positive
7538,"alan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he's done "" fame , "" "" the committments , "" "" bugsy malone , "" and "" pink floyd the wall "" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is .",positive
7539,"we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented .",positive
7540,his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is .,positive
7541,"and there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings "" don't cry for me , argentina , "" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is .",positive
7542,"madonna's golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film .",positive
7543,"at the beginning , she looks like she's too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) .",positive
7544,"her death , though , is brilliant .",positive
7545,her singing could be better though .,positive
7546,"i know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she's trying to hard .",positive
7547,she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti,positive
7548,"lupone - i heard her sing on an old "" evita "" cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) .",positive
7549,"but it's generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires .",positive
7550,"antonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i'm one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator .",positive
7551,"his singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin .",positive
7552,"he does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range .",positive
7553,"and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade .",positive
7554,"although it gets off to a rocky start ( "" rocky "" 's polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical .",positive
7555,"like the other musical released in '96 ( woody allen's "" everyone says i love you "" ) , it's a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance .",positive
7556,there's more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell .,positive
7557,"in how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality .",positive
7558,"all the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future .",positive
7559,motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative .,positive
7560,"the "" quilting bee "" consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , who has been having an affair with emma's husband ; anna ( maya angelou ) , the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna's daughter .",positive
7561,"the project they're busy with is the wedding quilt for hy's granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged .",positive
7562,"she's spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it's better to marry a friend or a lover .",positive
7563,one of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast .,positive
7564,"from winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , this film is overflowing with realized talent .",positive
7565,"the performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up many of the script's weaknesses .",positive
7566,"how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added .",positive
7567,there are probably too many characters .,positive
7568,"so , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives .",positive
7569,"we learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible .",positive
7570,"there are other episodes as well : the love of anna's life , marianna's soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend's husband .",positive
7571,the sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn's story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger .,positive
7572,there is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt .,positive
7573,"the stories are all well-told , but it's difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly .",positive
7574,"while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous .",positive
7575,"there isn't enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing .",positive
7576,"to put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn't "" do much "" for me .",positive
7577,"on the whole , how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships .",positive
7578,"finn's segment is by far the most compelling , because she's the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone else's experiences .",positive
7579,the other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees .,positive
7580,"if there's a disappointment here , it's that the script doesn't have more resonance , but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional .",positive
7581,mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er .,positive
7582,"her mast famous episode , "" love's labour lost "" , dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child .",positive
7583,the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing .,positive
7584,there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood's big blockbuster movies .,positive
7585,so it's only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster .,positive
7586,"and i have to say , after a shaky beginning , she does not disappoint .",positive
7587,"peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists , which is obviously nothing new .",positive
7588,"the first half hour goes into detail , way too much detail , about how the weapons are stolen .",positive
7589,"despite a few good images , including a train collision and a very impressive explosion , none of this was very coherent .",positive
7590,"it's long and drawn out , and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better .",positive
7591,"once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture , it begins to take off .",positive
7592,george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world .,positive
7593,he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters .,positive
7594,nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling .,positive
7595,"there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two , but that is dispensed with quickly .",positive
7596,"the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe , trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them . clooney",positive
7597,"goes through bouts of sarcasm , frustration , determination , and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt .",positive
7598,this is when leder starts to show her true stuff .,positive
7599,she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer .,positive
7600,then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter .,positive
7601,"then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york city's crowded streets , and a madman with a nuke walking among them .",positive
7602,mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense .,positive
7603,she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking .,positive
7604,nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero .,positive
7605,you're not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her .,positive
7606,george clooney is a real movie star .,positive
7607,"many of you may have hated him as batman , but this guy is for real .",positive
7608,"he has a natural screen presence , and an ingratiating personality .",positive
7609,he'll be around for a while .,positive
7610,dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker .,positive
7611,i have to say it .,positive
7612,tim burton's retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys .,positive
7613,"ok , that's off my chest .",positive
7614,"no more monkey puns , i promise .",positive
7615,"seriously , though , planet of the apes is one rip-roarin' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny ( dare i say , monkey ) business .",positive
7616,"i know , i know , i promised .",positive
7617,"and for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie .",positive
7618,"mark wahlberg stars as capt . leo davidson , a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future .",positive
7619,"he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery .",positive
7620,"despite being darker than the original , burton's film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious .",positive
7621,some of the movie's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed .,positive
7622,then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter .,positive
7623,"the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : "" one thing you don't want in your house is a human teen-ager , "" he says .",positive
7624,you don't have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement .,positive
7625,touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton's brand .,positive
7626,"lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian's foot to try righting himself are : "" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human . """,positive
7627,"anyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue .",positive
7628,"another of burton's in-jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth's gen . thade .",positive
7629,the young chimp goes to visit his dying father .,positive
7630,"both have one thing in common , a hatred of humans .",positive
7631,"with his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : "" damn them , damn them all to hell , "" he says before expiring .",positive
7632,that is the famous line heston's taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet's terrible secret .,positive
7633,the performances throughout are top-notch .,positive
7634,"wahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero , but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home .",positive
7635,he is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet .,positive
7636,this hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable .,positive
7637,"roth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity .",positive
7638,he leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet .,positive
7639,it is a masterful turn .,positive
7640,"helena bonham carter is ari , the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals .",positive
7641,"hers is a smart , compassionate characterization .",positive
7642,michael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken .,positive
7643,"a fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo , the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures .",positive
7644,"as the battle between apes and humans looms , the cowardly limbo pleads , "" can't we all just get along , "" echoing the words of rodney king .",positive
7645,"much of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton's technical crew , especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup .",positive
7646,"burton's musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow .",positive
7647,the movie's only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original .,positive
7648,"he comes close , but falls short .",positive
7649,"otherwise , planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action , stunts and a few laughs .",positive
7650,this is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype .,positive
7651,urban legend surprised me .,positive
7652,"based on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena .",positive
7653,"thankfully , legend rose above it's soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year .",positive
7654,"you're all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who's identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody's favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . . . the",positive
7655,only person you didn't suspect !,positive
7656,"however , just because legend doesn't really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can't qualify as first-class entertainment .",positive
7657,"it was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i've had at the movies all year .",positive
7658,"the thing is , i'm not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive .",positive
7659,"maybe it was the above-par performances by the movie's two leads ( jared leto and "" cybil "" actress alicia witt ) .",positive
7660,"or , it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks .",positive
7661,"more likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise .",positive
7662,i don't think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman .,positive
7663,"urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film .",positive
7664,a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill .,positive
7665,"one problem , though .",positive
7666,would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ?,positive
7667,i thought not .,positive
7668,"predictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company .",positive
7669,"it's odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody's on the other line .",positive
7670,"naturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off .",positive
7671,and the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! !,positive
7672,a decapitation .,positive
7673,it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car .,positive
7674,so who is it this time ?,positive
7675,"the obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends .",positive
7676,a-ha .,positive
7677,or could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ?,positive
7678,"like all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit .",positive
7679,"and it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn't suspect .",positive
7680,"i'm not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due .",positive
7681,and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun .,positive
7682,"* complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi , ca",positive
7683,capsule : the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi-day festivities .,positive
7684,"mira nair's film is pleasant enough with a little human drama , a few family secrets , some sadness and some happiness .",positive
7685,"you have seen it all before , but perhaps not from india .",positive
7686,the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable .,positive
7687,", low +2 ( -4 to +4 )",positive
7688,mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala .,positive
7689,"her newest film , written by sabrina dhawan , is very similar to previous films like betsy's wedding but it is set in new delhi .",positive
7690,a wealthy family is having a wedding .,positive
7691,an indian wedding is a multi-day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial .,positive
7692,"even more than in the us , it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get-together .",positive
7693,the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members' individual story lines .,positive
7694,"aditi verma is marrying hemant , an indian engineer working in the us .",positive
7695,"she had previously had a relationship with vikram , her supervisor .",positive
7696,"latit , her father ( played by naseeruddin shah ) , is juggling many problems , not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey .",positive
7697,dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration .,positive
7698,"even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice , one of the family servants .",positive
7699,"several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex , family secrets , or both .",positive
7700,there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love .,positive
7701,some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films .,positive
7702,western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna .,positive
7703,on the other hand it was not clear ( to me at least ) if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films .,positive
7704,this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english .,positive
7705,"the latter will , however , help with an international release .",positive
7706,sabrina dhawan's screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog .,positive
7707,"we have seen films with plotting very much like this , but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference .",positive
7708,director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life .,positive
7709,i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .,positive
7710,"the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man's life , especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances .",positive
7711,"thematically in cinema , love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters ; it is rare , however , for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni's neo-classic drama , life is beautiful .",positive
7712,"through a central cast of father , mother , and son , benigni demonstrates the wonderful , undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times .",positive
7713,"life * is * beautiful for guido orefice ( roberto benigni , directing himself here for the sixth time in his career ) , an italian jew , master con man , and aspiring waiter extraordinaire .",positive
7714,"living in 1930's italy , he lives a carefree life of good fortune ; it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora ( nicoletta braschi ) .",positive
7715,"although dora is already engaged , guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead ; the two have a child named joshua ( giorgio cantarini ) .",positive
7716,"unfortunately for the happy family , the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps .",positive
7717,it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie's theme of family love becomes the strongest .,positive
7718,"although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm , he relaxes the role to ensure his son's happiness .",positive
7719,"now , instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora , he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right .",positive
7720,"benigni's performance is truly a well-rounded one , and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year .",positive
7721,"the supports are all strong as well , but the movie truly excels in its script .",positive
7722,"life is beautiful is a self-proclaimed fable , one which tells its story in grand , two-part fashion .",positive
7723,"in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a "" saturday night live "" spinoff -- a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot -- but in the movie's second half the script's circular nature becomes admirably obvious .",positive
7724,"characters make reprise appearances in fine form , and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot's outcome .",positive
7725,"in all , fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture , and novice movie-watchers may take this opportunity to see their first "" artsy "" film .",positive
7726,"life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone , and above all is a fine thematic picture .",positive
7727,"while watching wes anderson's rushmore , it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer , the film's anti-hero , was not written with jason schwartzman in mind .",positive
7728,"the young actor , making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman .",positive
7729,"schwartzman plays max , a student who is more interested in his extra-curricular activities ( such as writing edgy plays like "" serpico "" and being president of the rushmore beekeepers ) but sees his grades suffer as a result .",positive
7730,"on the brink of being thrown out , he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume ( the great bill murray ) to build an aquarium ( on rushmore's baseball field ) in her honour .",positive
7731,"unfortunately for everyone involved , blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well , which gets in the way of max's plans to woo her .",positive
7732,"max is one of the best-written characters we've yet seen in the 90s , and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age .",positive
7733,"as everyone else has probably already pointed out , he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman ( although i was reminded more of paul from "" the wonder years "" , from a visual standpoint , at least ) .",positive
7734,"hopefully , if he avoids typecasting as weird , quirky loner-types he should earn himself a good career .",positive
7735,"bill murray is his equal as blume , displaying a depth we haven't yet seen from him .",positive
7736,while this isn't his best performance ( that honour goes to groundhog day ) he is still terrific here .,positive
7737,"williams isn't given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray , but still does fine work .",positive
7738,"rushmore seems to go just a little too long but , while it isn't a perfect film , it is a definate must-see for anyone who wants to see that rarity , an american coming-of-age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality .",positive
7739,"anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should , with any luck , rise to even greater success .",positive
7740,"no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , "" jude the obscure , "" his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life .",positive
7741,"but , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is .",positive
7742,""" jude "" is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what's remarkable is how timeless this film is .",positive
7743,"the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn't really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it'd be kinda different ( a given ) .",positive
7744,"it tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from "" shallow grave "" ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams .",positive
7745,"in its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world .",positive
7746,"after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life .",positive
7747,"taking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself .",positive
7748,"but when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker .",positive
7749,"another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher .",positive
7750,"she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) .",positive
7751,"several twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least . . . ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile .",positive
7752,"because they aren't married , and because they're cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on .",positive
7753,"if you didn't think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on . . .",positive
7754,the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world .,positive
7755,"he will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life .",positive
7756,"part of it is his fault - he's too optimistic , and too gullible .",positive
7757,"but society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death .",positive
7758,"the ending of "" jude "" is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i'll have to read it now ) .",positive
7759,""" jude "" offers a satirical view on society's cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn't .",positive
7760,"there's no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem .",positive
7761,"satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people's minds , and that's what "" jude "" is .",positive
7762,"sure , it's one hell of a downer , but it needs to be .",positive
7763,"the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads , and some good supporting work along with it .",positive
7764,"christopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times .",positive
7765,"kate winslet , in a pre- "" titanic "" performance , is brilliant , nailing every psyche of her character , and creating someone who's troubled but very seductive with her personality .",positive
7766,"kate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don't believe me , see "" titanic , "" branagh's "" hamlet , "" "" sense and sensibility , "" and "" heavenly creatures , "" the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) .",positive
7767,"in the supporting roles , liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher , exposing all his bad parts , but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude's wife , whom he never divorces .",positive
7768,""" jude "" moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts .",positive
7769,"but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate "" jude , "" though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it .",positive
7770,quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie .,positive
7771,"he runs into the last dragon in existence , and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth , but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain .",positive
7772,"eventually , they decide to call a truce , and they work out a deal .",positive
7773,"since he is the last dragon , he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it .",positive
7774,"their scam works at first , until they come to a town without any money .",positive
7775,"instead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon , but of course , draco is a nice droagon , so he won't eat her . there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl .",positive
7776,"of course , as you can probably tell by the plot , this is a silly movie , but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times , unlike eddie , which was serious all the time .",positive
7777,"you could probably call this a medieval comedy , because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined .",positive
7778,dennis quaid makes a fine hero .,positive
7779,pete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them .,positive
7780,dina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl .,positive
7781,"but lets face it , the movie is really about the dragon , and what an amazing creation he is .",positive
7782,connery's voice and ilm team up to provide us with a truly magnificent dragon .,positive
7783,"so , if you are going to see this movie for a strong hard core medieval epic , you are going to the wrong movie .",positive
7784,"if you are going because of the dragon , you will not be dissapointed , and you will be provided with plenty of laughs that smooth out the boring parts in the script .",positive
7785,it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters .,positive
7786,"his new film , the thin red line , is a strange , beautiful , enigmatic mess of a movie .",positive
7787,the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast .,positive
7788,it is filled with above-the-title stars .,positive
7789,"the cast , for the most part , gives great performances .",positive
7790,"john travolta , whose role is nothing more than a cameo , seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve .",positive
7791,"george clooney , whose role became a cameo in editing , gives a strange performance .",positive
7792,one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character's narration .,positive
7793,"the rest of the cast , especially nick nolte and elias koteas , are unambiguously fantastic .",positive
7794,"these actors ( and they are , with two exceptions , men ) were lured by the name of malick .",positive
7795,terrence malick is a cinematic legend .,positive
7796,"he has often been called "" the j . d . salinger of cinema . """,positive
7797,"his two previous films , badlands and days of heaven , are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures .",positive
7798,"after he made them , he disappeared for 20 years .",positive
7799,this film marks his return .,positive
7800,what he's made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment .,positive
7801,"the narration which fills the film ( and perplexes many ) not only lets us hear the narrators ( the characters themselves ) pontificate , but also lets us hear such of-the-moment thoughts as "" i'm scared . """,positive
7802,the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted .,positive
7803,the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill .,positive
7804,"a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult , because the story is fractured .",positive
7805,"many stories are here , from the clash between the lieutenant ( elias koteas ) and the savage colonel ( a voracious nick nolte ) to the private ( ben chaplin ) who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going .",positive
7806,the fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault .,positive
7807,"it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box , shook the box , and poured the results onto a table .",positive
7808,"this basically creates a mess , but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed .",positive
7809,i'm not declaring that the film has no structure .,positive
7810,"while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot , malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat .",positive
7811,the battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking .,positive
7812,the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice .,positive
7813,"this film uses color and light in such a fantastic way , that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video .",positive
7814,"ultimately , malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them .",positive
7815,the film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature .,positive
7816,"while some have said that the anti-war message and pro-nature tubthumping was juvenile , it was done with so much complexity and thought , that it cannot ever honestly be called childish .",positive
7817,"after seeing the thin red line , i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again .",positive
7818,""" stuart little "" is one of the best family films to come out this year .",positive
7819,"it's a cute , funny and very good-natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords .",positive
7820,"though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about , i do know that this film does not disappoint .",positive
7821,"finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be , with a few surprising twists , some very funny moments , and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie .",positive
7822,stuart little is a mouse .,positive
7823,"he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption , he now lives with the littles .",positive
7824,a nice little ( no pun intended ) family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city .,positive
7825,they have a little boy george ( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki ) and now they have a new son .,positive
7826,at first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat .,positive
7827,"george doesn't take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first , but once the two play together they instantly bond .",positive
7828,"stuart however is missing something , and he wants to know who his real parents are .",positive
7829,the littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back .,positive
7830,"hesitating the littles know what's best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat , he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart's past ending up to a sentimental and very heart-warming ending .",positive
7831,one thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects .,positive
7832,"just like in "" star wars : episode 1--the phantom menace "" stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real .",positive
7833,"from the detail of their fur , to the detail of the way the walk ; the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this $90 million dollar film and it shows .",positive
7834,"another movie that this has in common with is "" babe "" with it's talking animals and people understanding them .",positive
7835,it has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids .,positive
7836,"michael j . fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the "" homeward bound "" movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could .",positive
7837,he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable .,positive
7838,another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball .,positive
7839,"when he was timon in 1994's "" the lion king "" i would have sworn he was a comedian , and now in "" stuart little "" he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike .",positive
7840,for the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well .,positive
7841,she fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr . little .,positive
7842,"both make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996's "" jerry maguire "" .",positive
7843,"even though stuart little is completely cgi , the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other .",positive
7844,""" stuart little "" is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter .",positive
7845,"we get entertainment , laughs , cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie .",positive
7846,its nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see .,positive
7847,even though it has a $90 million dollar budget i'm sure it will make over that or just below it respectively .,positive
7848,"for all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie , i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know "" stuart little "" and "" toy story 2 "" are by far the best family films this year .",positive
7849,a winner . ?,positive
7850,"as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic .",positive
7851,"but also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride .",positive
7852,"once again , chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie , with no last name .",positive
7853,this jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television .,positive
7854,"of course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring .",positive
7855,"other plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant .",positive
7856,"the sole purpose of mr . nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint .",positive
7857,"director samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan's , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue .",positive
7858,"other impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw .",positive
7859,"none of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively .",positive
7860,"but the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ) .",positive
7861,"filmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker .",positive
7862,"hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before .",positive
7863,the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it's adequately explained by the commercials .,positive
7864,"with 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal .",positive
7865,"deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a "" pageant "" , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero .",positive
7866,"and if there wasn't anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington .",positive
7867,( a heist comedy ?,positive
7868,yup .,positive
7869,"deniro and hoffman are "" stealing "" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . )",positive
7870,wag the dog succeeds because it's based one great truth : the american people are stupid .,positive
7871,"ok , maybe it's not "" love thy neighbor as thyself "" or even "" two plus two makes four "" , but a truth nonetheless .",positive
7872,"( any average person who thinks that they're really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . )",positive
7873,"and because we're so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won't notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro's character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won't be able to locate albania on the map .",positive
7874,"the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn't a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness .",positive
7875,"nor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) .",positive
7876,"instead , david mamet's script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire .",positive
7877,"it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion .",positive
7878,"deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages .",positive
7879,"it's all : "" what do i love ?",positive
7880,what is it that brings me joy ?,positive
7881,"baseball , "" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat .",positive
7882,"he threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he's doing it in a very nice , polite way .",positive
7883,"it's a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script .",positive
7884,"hoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous .",positive
7885,"this kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he's so excited that he can't even shut up .",positive
7886,"even on the edge of disaster , he's bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive .",positive
7887,"insiders note that he's basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have .",positive
7888,the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast .,positive
7889,"the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don't .",positive
7890,"anne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside .",positive
7891,"denis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the "" fad king "" , who handles the profitable "" back-end "" -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money .",positive
7892,"they could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i'd go see it .",positive
7893,"willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious "" ballad of the green berets "" parody .",positive
7894,"woody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated "" hero "" of the albanian conflict .",positive
7895,"craig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift .",positive
7896,( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ),positive
7897,"wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on .",positive
7898,we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens .,positive
7899,wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don't .,positive
7900,"as the film opens up , expectant unwed mother sally ( played by drew barrymore ) encounters her baby's father in a fast food drive-through window .",positive
7901,"after he gets his milkshake , he drives off , only to be pursued by a military helicopter .",positive
7902,"from this moment forward , you know that this isn't going to be your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy .",positive
7903,"home fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian ( played by luke wilson ) , a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally . . . more",positive
7904,than he would care to admit ( hint : it has something to do with the father of sally's unborn child ) .,positive
7905,"after taking a personal ( and professional ) interest in her , he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works , and the fun goes on from there .",positive
7906,this movie is a lot of fun .,positive
7907,"it is comedic on two levels , as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy .",positive
7908,"the romantic moments are sweet , yet not sappy .",positive
7909,one of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes .,positive
7910,"however , the dark comedic moments are more memorable .",positive
7911,"this is also a tale of revenge , and a funny one at that .",positive
7912,"the father of sally's unborn child also happened to be a married man , whose wife is played by catherine o'hara .",positive
7913,"she does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair , and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work .",positive
7914,"( my apologies if this sounds cryptic , but there is too much of the plot to give away ) .",positive
7915,"rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus , dorian's overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy , dorian's trainer at the fast food restaurant .",positive
7916,"the dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones , even with the romantic nature of the plot .",positive
7917,"if there are any complaints , it is over drew barrymore's performance .",positive
7918,"while she does light up the screen , there are moments when she doesn't seem all that convincing .",positive
7919,"the movie was filmed in texas , and most of the characters have southern texan accents .",positive
7920,drew barrymore's accent tends to come and go ( luke wilson doesn't seem to have this problem ) .,positive
7921,"as well , she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant .",positive
7922,"still , this movie is one that will please many viewers .",positive
7923,"with plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments , this is sure to entertain .",positive
7924,"the second jackal-based film to come out in 1997 ( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal ) , this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland , and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo's own alma matter , concordia university in montreal , canada .",positive
7925,"the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal , but does not pretend to be 100% factual .",positive
7926,"plot : naval officer ramirez ( quinn ) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal , in order to put an end to the actual militant's radical activities .",positive
7927,he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee .,positive
7928,"ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this "" assignment "" , and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism , intrigue and double-personality syndrome ( which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states . )",positive
7929,critique : great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two-hour runtime .,positive
7930,"admittedly , i wasn't a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film , and didn't expect much from this movie beforehand , but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments , as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line .",positive
7931,"the first hour is mostly just a build-up of things to come , and does offer a great characterization of the jackal , but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending .",positive
7932,"quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal , but didn't offer anything extraordinary , in my opinion .",positive
7933,"sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they've played in both of their respective careers of late , but nonetheless , appeared to relish the cold-heartedness of their chosen characters .",positive
7934,"i didn't like performance put forth from quinn's wife in this flick , but then again , she doesn't show up in most of the film , so that wasn't so bad .",positive
7935,i did however enjoy director duguay's interesting style and cinematic vision .,positive
7936,"this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences , but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer .",positive
7937,i thought that was neat .,positive
7938,"having said that , i didn't think the first hour needed to be as long as it was , and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the "" fake "" jackal met with the "" real "" jackal's girlfriend without much retrospection on her part , but all in all , not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre .",positive
7939,"little known facts : ben kingsley's real name is krishna banji , he stands 5 "" 8 , was born in scarborough , england , and won the best actor honor in 1982's academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi .",positive
7940,"many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal , canada ( joblo's haven of restfulness ) .",positive
7941,"donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland , is canadian , and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal .",positive
7942,"one of the last entries in the long-running carry on series , carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a 'caravan' site .",positive
7943,professors anna vrooshka ( elke sommer ) and roland crump ( kenneth williams ) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep ( kenneth connor ) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains .,positive
7944,"anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick : - for instance , when anna is asking for 'scrubbers for dirty caravan' , she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan !",positive
7945,arthur upmore ( bernard bresslaw ) and his wife linda ( patsy rowlands ) take her mother daphne barnes ( joan sims ) and her minah bird on holiday with them .,positive
7946,mother-in-law jokes prevail .,positive
7947,"furthermore , the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families .",positive
7948,fred ramsden ( windsor davies ) and ernie bragg ( jack douglas ) leave their wives ( liz fraser and patricia franklin ) behind for a fishing holiday .,positive
7949,"however , they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls , sandra ( carol hawkins ) and carol ( sherrie hewson ) .",positive
7950,"the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day-to-day running of the camp , the search for the minah bid and greyhound , the major , fred and ernie's desperate need of a woman , a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park's pub , and a shock in store for daphne .",positive
7951,the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing .,positive
7952,this is what binds the movie together .,positive
7953,"joan sims stands out as the demanding mother-in-law , bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife , and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast .",positive
7954,"on the other hand , there are low-key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman , and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen !",positive
7955,"even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman , there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors .",positive
7956,"although the regular cast is depleted , the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film .",positive
7957,"a relative flop at the cinema , this movie deserves a lot more recognition .",positive
7958,"the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : "" it mu5t be found . """,positive
7959,"so what , exactly , is the fifth element ?",positive
7960,"after seeing luc besson's ambitious , much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think .",positive
7961,"but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen .",positive
7962,"the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film .",positive
7963,"speaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements--earth , wind , fire , and water--united with a fifth element can stop it .",positive
7964,"figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson's the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) .",positive
7965,"all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest .",positive
7966,"what remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain .",positive
7967,the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last .,positive
7968,"the frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film .",positive
7969,"but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren't equally as interesting , and are they ever .",positive
7970,"in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna's pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour .",positive
7971,"gaulthier's outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson's futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film .",positive
7972,"while besson's bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience .",positive
7973,"for all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre .",positive
7974,"i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed .",positive
7975,"at first this character's hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly .",positive
7976,"not irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno .",positive
7977,"the tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra's innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring .",positive
7978,"then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot .",positive
7979,the story's weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element .,positive
7980,"while still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be .",positive
7981,"the big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward .",positive
7982,"as such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters .",positive
7983,"this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the "" enemy "" --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made .",positive
7984,"still , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ; rarely does a filmmaker's original vision come to the screen in all its audacious , undiluted glory .",positive
7985,it is a fascinating example of how of one artist's fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams .,positive
7986,""" very bad things , "" is the most delightfully morbid film of the year , a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn't help but be won over by the material .",positive
7987,the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas .,positive
7988,"the groom-to-be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) , who is about to be married to the controlling , wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz ) .",positive
7989,"the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater ) , quiet charles ( leland orser ) , and brothers , michael ( jeremy piven ) and family man adam ( daniel stern ) .",positive
7990,"after a wild night of gambling , boozing , and drugs , a stripper ( carla scott ) who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room , but after a freak accident , to everyone's terror , she is killed .",positive
7991,"as robert puts it : "" there are two options : go to the police and go to prison , or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her . """,positive
7992,"after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body , robert is forced to kill him as well .",positive
7993,""" okay , there is only one option now .",positive
7994,"you can forget about calling the police , "" he says .",positive
7995,"by the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer , most of them are overcome with guilt , which sets off an even more elaborate series of event , that includes much , much more murder , double-crosses , and the inevitable wedding from hell .",positive
7996,""" very bad things , "" which is actor peter berg's feature film directing debut , is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that , "" there's something about mary , "" wanted to be .",positive
7997,"it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh , original , and hilarious , even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence , gore , and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end .",positive
7998,"the screenplay , also written by berg , is , to put it mildly , very funny and courageous .",positive
7999,"during the second act of the film , some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death , which was beginning to undermine the humor , but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed .",positive
8000,"the dialogue is edgy and inventive , and this film proves that a movie doesn't necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable .",positive
8001,"there's more fun , i think , in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts .",positive
8002,"cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here , and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura , who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends .",positive
8003,diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january .,positive
8004,"by the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger , and reciting lines like , "" stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs , "" i couldn't help but crack up at how "" balls-to-the-wall "" this film had become .",positive
8005,"jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original , as daniel stern's wife , who late in the picture , we discover , is a tough kick-boxer that should not be messed around with .",positive
8006,"it is at this level that , "" very bad things , "" was so entertaining and surprising .",positive
8007,"just when you thought you could predict what was going to happen , there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky .",positive
8008,the last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over-the-top .,positive
8009,"although i enjoyed the film immensely , let me make this clear : "" very bad things , "" is not a movie for everyone .",positive
8010,"it is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen , it is more violent and bloody than a r-rated film usually is , and it is offensive .",positive
8011,"luckily , these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy , since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no-holds-barred , politically incorrect comedy .",positive
8012,"the fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and "" safe "" wide-releases coming out lately , still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry .",positive
8013,"it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive , so delicate , so insightful and yes , even so enjoyable .",positive
8014,"somehow , the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through .",positive
8015,"set in the 1940's , the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire , ride with the devil ) .",positive
8016,"an orphan , twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents , he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr . wilbur larch ( michael caine , little voice ) , father figure to the orphans of st . cloud , obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help .",positive
8017,"figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage , he might as well be of use , dr . larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics .",positive
8018,soon homer is delivering babies like a professional .,positive
8019,"he refuses to perform abortions , instead wondering why the couples just didn't behave more responsibly .",positive
8020,"larch , too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals , marvels that homer "" continues to have such high expectations of people . """,positive
8021,such is the result of an insulated upbringing .,positive
8022,"though skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else .",positive
8023,"he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world , he must go out into it .",positive
8024,"befriending a young couple who had come to see dr . larch , he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived .",positive
8025,"thus , homer begins his worldly instruction , with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron , the astronaut's wife ) a willing tutor .",positive
8026,tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life's questions . . .,positive
8027,many of which he was unaware needed to be asked .,positive
8028,he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing .,positive
8029,"michael caine is , in a word , brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans , many of whom he helped to bring into the world .",positive
8030,"calling them "" princes of maine , kings of new england "" in his ritualistic goodnight , mr . caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine .",positive
8031,"delroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr . rose , the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins .",positive
8032,"director lasse hallstrom ( what's eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter/novelist john irving ( the world according to garp ) , who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter .",positive
8033,"regardless of one's personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion , it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers .",positive
8034,the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers .,positive
8035,"figuring the rules didn't apply to them since they didn't have a hand in writing them , they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along .",positive
8036,"dr . larch , in his own way , acts similarly .",positive
8037,there is a danger in that line of reasoning .,positive
8038,god has also given us a set of rules .,positive
8039,"unlike the list posted in the cider house , god's rules , if followed , promise us benefits beyond our imagination .",positive

8044,"known as the most successful , highest-grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with "" pretty woman , "" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone .",positive
8045,"the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film's two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable .",positive
8046,"the other winning element that makes "" pretty woman "" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today's films as it is here .",positive
8047,"edward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend's car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel .",positive
8048,"stopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions .",positive
8049,"agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor .",positive
8050,"this meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he'd rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night .",positive
8051,"just as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear .",positive
8052,"the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers .",positive
8053,"since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss .",positive
8054,"allegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , "" pretty woman "" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la "" cinderella . """,positive
8055,the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been .,positive
8056,"you honestly don't need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha .",positive
8057,"the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner .",positive
8058,"and yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , "" pretty woman "" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers .",positive
8059,"you'd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i've seen on film in the 1990's .",positive
8060,"additionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts .",positive
8061,"playing sex symbols throughout the '80s with such pictures as "" american gigolo "" and "" an officer and a gentleman , "" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa .",positive
8062,"julia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988's well-received "" mistic pizza "" and 1989's "" steel magnolia , "" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence .",positive
8063,"it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing .",positive
8064,"after "" pretty woman , "" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released "" runaway bride , "" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder .",positive
8065,"roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star .",positive
8066,"an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances .",positive
8067,"no only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path .",positive
8068,"on the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel's lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty .",positive
8069,"another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days .",positive
8070,""" pretty woman "" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you'd expect , and wouldn't have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances .",positive
8071,"this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem .",positive
8072,"helped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian's best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie's overall fulfillment , "" pretty woman "" is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy .",positive
8073,"the dramatic comedy cousins has all the necessary ingredients : a witty and whimsical script , inspired performances , a great sense of humor , a large and wonderful cast , and the beautiful scenery of vancouver .",positive
8074,"it's a movie of weddings , marriage , family , infidelity , and--oh yes--love .",positive
8075,"like 3 men and a baby , cousins is an americanized version of a french film : 1975's cousin , cousine .",positive
8076,"the plot is complicated , but it goes something like this .",positive
8077,"larry and tom are cousins , each of whom is not-so-happily-married .",positive
8078,"tom starts an affair with larry's wife , tish , and to get even , larry and tom's wife , maria , pretend to have an affair of their own .",positive
8079,soon the pretending turns to love and cousins is off and running .,positive
8080,cousins is populated by a wide assortment of interesting characters and caricatures .,positive
8081,"the acting is first rate down to even the smallest supporting role , and virtually every performance deserves mention .",positive
8082,ted danson ( in his first starring film role ) finally gets to play a character with some depth and sensitivity .,positive
8083,"while larry may be confident and charming like sam malone on "" cheers , "" he is also complex and vulnerable , with more between his ears than empty space .",positive
8084,"as maria , isabella rossellini is a joy to watch ; she is shy , sensuous , and immensely alluring .",positive
8085,"sean young is perfectly cast as larry's picture perfect wife , tish , a superficial and trendy make-up consultant .",positive
8086,"keith coogan , from adventures in babysitting , is wonderfully weird and eccentric as larry's rebellious son , mitch .",positive
8087,"and finally , lloyd bridges in a tour de force performance is mitch's rambunctious grandfather ; he provides some of cousins' best lines and laughs .",positive
8088,"like moonstruck , cousins is a mix of drama and comedy .",positive
8089,the film is larger than life and has a keen sense of the absurd .,positive
8090,it understands human nature extremely well and milks it for every possible laugh and heart-tug .,positive
8091,"how often do you see a movie where you believe that two characters truly and sincerely care for and love each other , as friends and as lovers ?",positive
8092,"well , to its credit , cousins is just such a movie .",positive
8093,let's hope the french continue to provide us with the inspiration to make films like cousins,positive
8094,"this remake of "" la cage aux folles "" features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son's future in-laws .",positive
8095,"the couple ( robin williams and nathan lane ) are about as archetypal , or as the less kind might put it ? stereotypical , gays possible .",positive
8096,williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star .,positive
8097,they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode .,positive
8098,williams is excellent as should be no surprise .,positive
8099,gene hackman as right-wing potential father-in-law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles .,positive
8100,the real star is lane .,positive
8101,his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight-shooting uncle is hilarious .,positive
8102,"perhaps it is a personal failing on my part , but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it .",positive
8103,"luckily ( for me at least ) , it doesn't last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men , their son and the deception .",positive
8104,the question of stereotypes is a touchy one .,positive
8105,these guys personify the homophobic gay image .,positive
8106,you can almost hear the swishing .,positive
8107,"if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world , you'll be outraged .",positive
8108,"but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals , you'll love it .",positive
8109,your choice .,positive

8112,( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface .,positive
8113,i'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis . ),positive
8114,as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ?,positive
8115,never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old .,positive
8116,never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released .,positive
8117,"never mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything .",positive
8118,"and also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader .",positive
8119,"before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs ) .",positive
8120,"as has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one ) .",positive
8121,"george lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically .",positive
8122,"in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons .",positive
8123,with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . . .,positive
8124,second trilogy . . .,positive
8125,well you know what i mean ) .,positive
8126,"and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution .",positive
8127,"[critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule .",positive
8128,"critic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it . '",positive
8129,"because so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ]",positive
8130,first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it .,positive
8131,"we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire .",positive
8132,"we know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . '",positive
8133,"we also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) .",positive
8134,"what we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth .",positive
8135,"to me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity .",positive
8136,"also , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended .",positive
8137,"most notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine .",positive
8138,"for those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) .",positive
8139,"with `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights .",positive
8140,"unfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained .",positive
8141,i didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness .,positive
8142,if you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) .,positive
8143,but i digress .,positive
8144,i've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself .,positive
8145,all these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself .,positive
8146,what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s .,positive
8147,"its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality .",positive
8148,"the basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times .",positive
8149,we're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo .,positive
8150,"we're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly .",positive
8151,"we're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) .",positive
8152,"the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) .",positive
8153,"the leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears .",positive
8154,"he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series .",positive
8155,sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person .,positive
8156,"clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers .",positive
8157,i have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) .,positive
8158,but it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along .,positive
8159,the film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another .,positive
8160,there are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook .,positive
8161,"the other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting .",positive
8162,the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits .,positive
8163,"as we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story .",positive
8164,"and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council .",positive
8165,"to briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation .",positive
8166,their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force .,positive
8167,"jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves .",positive
8168,this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before .,positive
8169,"in fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before .",positive
8170,the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary .,positive
8171,by the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot .,positive
8172,"it's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence .",positive
8173,not that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history .,positive
8174,and at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter .,positive
8175,"it does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society .",positive
8176,`the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness .,positive
8177,so many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited .,positive
8178,but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies .,positive
8179,"the story of us , a rob reiner film , is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film , as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films .",positive
8180,"well , 1999 has two of them , the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family , american beauty .",positive
8181,"the story of us , a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family , is a well written , heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience , including myself , cry .",positive
8182,"the story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan , and asks the question , "" can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ? """,positive
8183,"the film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are "" him "" and "" her "" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are "" us "" ( during the good times ) .",positive
8184,the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day .,positive
8185,"ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don't want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don't , love each other anymore .",positive
8186,"ben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage .",positive
8187,"katie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn't mind doing things differently than they were planned .",positive
8188,"the story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks .",positive
8189,"as the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage .",positive
8190,"this method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart .",positive
8191,"through the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character's eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters .",positive
8192,"the screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson's films , stepmom .",positive
8193,"the script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must .",positive
8194,"if it wasn't for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year's best picture .",positive
8195,"bruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer's the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script .",positive
8196,"although i wouldn't pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film's most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season .",positive
8197,where to start about michelle pfeiffer ?,positive
8198,"pfeiffer's performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong , as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion , you wonder how , how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism .",positive
8199,"pfeiffer's performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring , will be in the heart's of any viewer that has watched this moving film .",positive
8200,"the story of us is one of 1999's most real , yet funny films , as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked .",positive
8201,"superb acting , direction , writing , story , and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film , which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman , make the story of us a touching , unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country- and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall .",positive
8202,"the film's major high points are the fights between ben and katie , as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed , and although they also say things like "" it's over , "" or "" i hate you , "" you can tell the two still share a deep connection , and that inside , somewhere , they are still an "" us . """,positive
8203,"the bottom line : a wonderful , enchanting , and heartbreaking film .",positive
8204,"one of the most realistic , heartbreaking films in recent years .",positive
8205,"warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career .",positive
8206,"based on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system .",positive
8207,"beatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who's going through a nervous breakdown .",positive
8208,"after hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what's _really_ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt . )",positive
8209,"instead of everyone hating him , the american public love him .",positive
8210,"however , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin .",positive
8211,and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry . ),positive
8212,it's remarkable that this film was released at all .,positive
8213,"much more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name .",positive
8214,"the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true .",positive
8215,it's great that beatty isn't afraid to let loose on a subject .,positive
8216,"talking of beatty , he's excellent in the role of the demented senator , clearing having fun .",positive
8217,and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed .,positive
8218,"even in dick tracy , he was the most straighten face actor .",positive
8219,"( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see . )",positive
8220,"the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well . )",positive
8221,and seeing beatty as a 'homeboy' has to be seen to be believed .,positive
8222,it's nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself .,positive
8223,"second best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps .",positive
8224,"halle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator .",positive
8225,"also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent , laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she's also played , and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife , who all contribute to the fun .",positive
8226,"and , this being a political film , the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance , as , * shock * , himself .",positive
8227,"the writing and directing , both by beatty , are above par .",positive
8228,"the direction is very nearly sitcom like , but suits the film perfectly , and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well .",positive
8229,"the script is funny , and the raps are actually well produced and humorous , and quite clever .",positive
8230,"they're not cringe inducing , at least .",positive
8231,"the script makes many points about society in america today , and isn't afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system .",positive
8232,"best of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining .",positive
8233,there's also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes .,positive
8234,"bulworth is a film with many advantages , and few flaws .",positive
8235,"perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping , but beatty does it so well it's irrelevant .",positive
8236,"in fact , there's very little against bulworth , except for the language which is very heavy , but then again it should be expected .",positive
8237,"bulworth , then , is well worth watching .",positive
8238,a david wilcock review ? 1999,positive
8239,""" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes",positive
8240,"the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs .",positive
8241,"doubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor's first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting .",positive
8242,"it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989's dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive .",positive
8243,"his next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster .",positive
8244,"and so , after a six-year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams .",positive
8245,"williams is the title character , hunter "" patch "" adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean-shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting .",positive
8246,we're introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies .,positive
8247,"it's at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people .",positive
8248,"he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia's medical college , where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating , impersonal trade .",positive
8249,"his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion , and the movie climaxes with patch's appearance before the state medical board .",positive
8250,the characters are well-defined in an oscar-worthy sense .,positive
8251,although the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there's little story to be told outside of patch's skit-length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters .,positive
8252,"at medical school , patch meets up with truman schiff ( daniel london ) , an outsider like himself who relishes patch's zest for humanity .",positive
8253,"the two instantly become the best of friends , and it's easy to see why .",positive
8254,"monica potter plays patch's love interest , a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school .",positive
8255,"for some reason he's attracted to her , and although it never gets said , the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view .",positive
8256,the script -- based on hunter adams' own story -- works well this way .,positive
8257,"the rest of the cast , bob gunton as the villain professor in particular , is solid .",positive
8258,"director tom shadyac ( liar liar ) leads us in and out of patch's life in a sound , intentional manner ; combined with williams' presence on screen , the movie rarely becomes boring .",positive
8259,"patch adams' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming , and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours , there's little feeling of continuity or the passage of time .",positive
8260,"nevertheless , it's an emotionally moving picture , and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season .",positive
8261,"it succeeds at everything it tries , and only fails at the stuff it doesn't try in the first place .",positive
8262,"by and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams , but more importantly , it's entertainment for the entire family .",positive
8263,"in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy's jack ryan series , _the_fugitive_ , and last year's smash _air_force_one_ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system .",positive
8264,"apparently , it was just lying dormant .",positive
8265,"with ivan reitman's enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure _six_days , _seven_nights_ , the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons .",positive
8266,"ford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropics whose broken-down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island .",positive
8267,"of course , the sophisticated robin and the salt-of-the-earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting .",positive
8268,"while some of the lines fall flat , the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche .",positive
8269,"both actors , who have largely done serious works as of late , seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders , and they deliver their zingers , as weak as they sometimes are , with beguiling abandon .",positive
8270,"naturally , there's nothing like a life-threatening crisis to bring two people together , and quinn and robin's warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates .",positive
8271,"granted , some conflict needed to be introduced on the island , but this tacked-on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes .",positive
8272,"but the point is to get the two together , and their newfound affection causes complications for both , but mostly robin , who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank ( david schwimmer ) , who frantically awaits her return on the home island .",positive
8273,"reitman , and old , reliable hand at breezy comedies , keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action-oriented sequences .",positive
8274,"his big accomplishment , however , is bringing the old , smiling ford back .",positive
8275,"as appealing and charismatic as he always is , ford hasn't been quite this charming and affable in years ; he's obviously having a blast , and the audience cannot help but have one along with him .",positive
8276,"holding her own is heche , whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be ( as the plane goes down , she frantically pops stress pills ) .",positive
8277,"she can take her lumps , physical and otherwise , just as well as quinn , making her a formidable foil and ideal match .",positive
8278,"formulaic and light as a feather , _six_days , _seven_nights_ could be cited as a classic example of the summer "" popcorn "" movie season's lack of substance .",positive
8279,"it's certainly fluff , but it's unpretentious , undemanding , and--most importantly--fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach .",positive
8280,pass the popcorn .,positive
8281,"near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king .",positive
8282,"the following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia .",positive
8283,"at best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry .",positive
8284,"in 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different .",positive
8285,"there have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged .",positive
8286,dreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed .,positive
8287,"the other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively .",positive
8288,"although camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner .",positive
8289,"unfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition .",positive
8290,"in making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product .",positive
8291,"the animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date .",positive
8292,"the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with .",positive
8293,"the key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot .",positive
8294,"namely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d .",positive
8295,"dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney .",positive
8296,"the story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent .",positive
8297,"for the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense .",positive
8298,"the writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way .",positive
8299,"in fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything .",positive
8300,"moses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family .",positive
8301,"moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves .",positive
8302,"by this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention .",positive
8303,"the cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin .",positive
8304,"the script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting .",positive
8305,"it's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost .",positive
8306,"but for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch .",positive
8307,"capsule : a rock and roll fable , indeed .",positive
8308,"like a hubert selby , jr . novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan and bruce springsteen , and a ton of fun .",positive
8309,"streets of fire bills itself as "" a rock and roll fable "" , and the description is perfect .",positive
8310,"this is a stylish , great-looking , and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like a hubert selby , jr . , novel with a damon runyan rewrite , irected by bruce springsteen .",positive
8311,"noir is one of the few truly american movie genres , aside from the hollywood musical and the western .",positive
8312,"this is post-wwii brooklyn noir , for lack of a better label , with a generous injection of rock 'n roll and an all-around confrontational attitude .",positive
8313,it all works .,positive
8314,"the plot is simplicity itself : rocker ellen aim ( diane lane ) is kidnapped by a vicious street gang , led by a bloodthirsty fellow named raven ( willem dafoe , very nasty ) .",positive
8315,"her old soldier flame ( played by michael pare ) comes back into town to save her , but doesn't count on a whole bunch of things going askew .",positive
8316,"that's about the entire plot , save for the spats with ellen's manager ( a hilarious rick moranis ) , an encounter with a doo-wop group that winds up becoming ellen's supporting act , and a whole gang of other fun little touches .",positive
8317,"but in movies like this , when is the plot important ?",positive
8318,"the movie is all style , all visuals and attitudes , quotable lines and posturing -- and it delivers all those things consistently and with great brio and pacing .",positive
8319,"no surprise that it was directed by walter hill ( 48 hrs . ) , who understands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly , and has put together a movie that's a mixture of times and sensibilities , but perfectly unified in tone .",positive
8320,"when was the last time you could say something like that about a movie , especially a movie where it seems like someone gets decked on the jaw ( * and * passes out ) every 2 . 63 minutes on cue ?",positive
8321,"streets of fire isn't the greatest movie ever made , but it occupies a totally unique little niche , and enjoys the position it has .",positive
8322,"anyone with a weakness for doo-wop , neon , motorcycles , rainy streets , the el , studebakers , gang pictures , lonely heroes , and a great-looking gal giving the microphone both lungs will eat this movie up .",positive
8323,i did .,positive
8324,"jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway .",positive
8325,"in as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where .",positive
8326,he's mean .,positive
8327,i mean really mean .,positive
8328,the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium .,positive
8329,"every day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress .",positive
8330,"you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe .",positive
8331,"one day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks .",positive
8332,"at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too .",positive
8333,"another person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor .",positive
8334,"aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target .",positive
8335,"simon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better .",positive
8336,"when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces .",positive
8337,this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage .,positive
8338,"an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him .",positive
8339,"it doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love .",positive
8340,one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others .,positive
8341,"he's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows .",positive
8342,"good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt .",positive
8343,they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen .,positive
8344,"greg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon .",positive
8345,"he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels .",positive
8346,"cuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance .",positive
8347,"the screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny .",positive
8348,"the best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting .",positive
8349,"melvin is a man we can't quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention .",positive
8350,"carol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem .",positive
8351,"simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society .",positive
8352,"combined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film .",positive
8353,"the one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half .",positive
8354,"his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved .",positive
8355,"i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film's conclusion .",positive
8356,"there's one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie's best scenes and who deserves mention .",positive
8357,this is that little dog .,positive
8358,"he plays such a pivotal role to melvin's character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene-stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal .",positive

8371,"cross-cutting among interviews and filmed segments , morris traces the lives of four disparate professionals who seem to share nothing but an immersion in their work , and then threads them around one another in an intricate quadruple helix .",positive

8373,"what morris manages is something akin to an intellectual magic trick , an interrogative sleight of hand .",positive

8380,"and the circus trainer pines for a long-lost ideal that was exemplified by world-renowned trainer and showman clyde beatty , who starred in such serials as zombies of the stratosphere ( excerpted at some length here , with affection ) .",positive

8382,"fast , cheap & out of control contains a multitude of parallels and tiny intersections , culminating in what feels like an elegy ( the film is dedicated to morris's late mother and stepfather ) .",positive
8383,the film is balanced on that airy precipice dividing the already musty past from the alternately exhilarating and terrifying space that is the future .,positive
8384,"( the title is taken from brooks' wish that nasa would send a payload of hundreds of expendable robots to scurry about the martian surface , creating a sort of road map for the terrain -- fast , cheap , and out of control . )",positive
8385,"with able assists from editors karen schmeer and shondra merrill and cinematographer robert richardson ( oliver stone's longtime collaborator ) , this becomes a cinematic contraption that's a wonder of narrative divergence and coherence .",positive
8386,( further enhancing the picture's wacky intellectual mood is the playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson . ),positive
8387,"different story threads inform and comment on one another with the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film , or a surrealist dream .",positive
8388,"by cobbling together out of these motley musings a thesis on the nature of craftsmanship , invention , and existence itself , morris reveals the presence of cosmic themes -- creation , evolution , death -- in earthbound lives .",positive
8389,"at the same time , and just as significantly , he pays tribute to a consuming passion for one's work .",positive
8390,"this breakdown of the dichotomy between the everyday and the extraordinary is likely as profound as anything you'll encounter in pop culture this year , and the visuals cry out for the big screen .",positive

8393,"the deer hunter , directed by michael cimino , is truly one of the greatest movies ever made .",positive
8394,"a captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russian-american pennsylvania community , the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget .",positive
8395,"in this academy award winner for best picture of 1978 , outstanding performances are turned in by all actors , and cimino's brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the character's lives .",positive
8396,the first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together .,positive
8397,"michael , portrayed perfectly by robert de niro , is shown early on as the natural leader of the group .",positive
8398,"after a days work , the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar , where john ( george dzundza ) works .",positive
8399,"three of the men , michael , steven ( john savage ) , and nick ( christopher walken ) will be leaving shortly for vietnam , but not before steven gets married .",positive
8400,"after the marriage , the group , including axel ( chuck aspegren ) , spend one last day on a hunting trip , one of their favorite past-times .",positive
8401,"this sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men , who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war .",positive
8402,"the wedding scenes , although criticized by many as being quite long , actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act .",positive
8403,"the outstanding performances by de niro , walken , streep , savage , and cazale , who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed , really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future .",positive
8404,"the second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam , stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong .",positive
8405,the men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river .,positive
8406,"this prison , run by the v . c . ,",positive
8407,"initiates the horrifying scenes in the movie , where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other .",positive
8408,"steven , who is emotionally marred by this turn of events , is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate .",positive
8409,"michael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other , and moreover , they must play with 3 bullets in the gun .",positive
8410,"personally , i felt that de niro's absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes .",positive
8411,"the men are eventually able to escape , but are separated .",positive
8412,"michael is able to get steven , who ends up losing his legs , to medical care , while nick finds his way to saigon and a u . s . army hospital .",positive

8418,michael has learned that nick is possibly still alive and returns to saigon to attempt to find him .,positive
8419,"the two narrowly find each other at the russian roulette games , but do not link up until michael discovers nick participating in the games and tries to bring him home .",positive
8420,"a very emotional , and , for many , a very disturbing movie , the deer hunter is a truly magnificent movie that should not be missed .",positive
8421,"the greatest performances possible are turned in by all actors , and cimino's directing , which is considered to be at his all-time best in this film , is equally dazzling .",positive
8422,"do not miss this film , it will captivate and astound you .",positive
8423,"with storytelling this compelling , who needs books ?",positive
8424,"based on the book by author james ellroy , l . a . confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years .",positive
8425,"together with director curtis hanson ( the hand that rocks the cradle , the river wild ) whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film , resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight , an atom would have to squeeze itself through .",positive
8426,"set in the 50s , the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities .",positive
8427,"jack vincennes ( spacey ) is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style , concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention .",positive
8428,"there is also the young hot-shot rookie , ed exley ( pearce ) , fresh out of the academy and all-out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father .",positive
8429,"the tough and unnerving bud white ( crowe ) , a cop who believes in justice , the swift and violent way .",positive
8430,"3 policemen , distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction between good and evil .",positive
8431,"when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation , bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just a simple robbery murder .",positive
8432,"even after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case , happenings began to link itself to the murder .",positive
8433,the 3 eventually reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organised-crime in hollywood .,positive
8434,the last time i remember a film so clever and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects .,positive
8435,"in l . a . confidential , you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of `story' going for it .",positive
8436,there is not a single moment in the film in which i felt was slow at all .,positive
8437,"surprisingly , though spacey did a very convincing job as the street-wise vincennes , the movie was carried mostly by the two rather `unknowns' , pearce and crowe .",positive
8438,pearce's exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance .,positive
8439,"crowe's bud white is the most impressive of all ; head-strong and temperamental , he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here .",positive
8440,"superb acting . , wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever .",positive
8441,easily the best hollywood piece for 1997 .,positive
8442,"synopsis : committed to an asylum , the marquis de sade ( rush ) continues to publish pornographic literature , aided by young maid madeleine ( winslet ) .",positive
8443,"abbe coulmier ( phoenix ) , who runs the hospital , disapproves of the stories , but humours him in the hope of achieving a cure .",positive
8444,"de sade's craft and life are threatened when the emperor dispatches dr royer-collard ( michael caine ) to stop the marquis' work , permanently .",positive
8445,"review : "" quills "" is an exploration of the marquis de sade : his madness , his cruelty and his perversion , his obsession with sex in any form , no matter how obscene .",positive
8446,"but "" quills "" also details the marquis' determination : to write in spite of the obstacles put in his path , and to propagate his words to the masses .",positive
8447,"the extent to which de sade is willing to go to practise his trade is amongst the movie's most intriguing elements , as when de sade scribes a story in his own blood , or narrates a tale via of a chain of fellow inmates , cell to cell .",positive
8448,"to provide a contrast with the marquis , wright involves him with two very different characters .",positive
8449,"one is the abbe , a handsome , charming and kindly man whose desires are stymied by his oath to god .",positive
8450,"the abbe lusts for madeleine , but it is the wizened marquis who is able to have her .",positive
8451,"and then there is royer-collard , a hypocrite who in truth is as sadistic as any of the marquis' motley creations .",positive
8452,"rush is splendid as de sade , utterly inhabiting the character .",positive
8453,"kaufman's direction is fine , and he is able to bring a sense of bizarre humour to the grim proceedings .",positive
8454,"the plot itself is rather mundane and plays out unsurprisingly , but this is virtually unimportant .",positive
8455,"for two hours , "" quills "" acquaints us with the marquis de sade -- and , more frightening still , allows us brief insight into his scatological soul .",positive
8456,"with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous "" ellen "" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines .",positive
8457,"the birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy .",positive
8458,"then along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released .",positive
8459,"it's also noticeable that this "" alternative lifestyle "" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort .",positive
8460,"while it's a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety .",positive
8461,but the way we're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically .,positive
8462,"while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy .",positive
8463,"it doesn't poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it's comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been .",positive
8464,the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia .,positive
8465,"if you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life .",positive
8466,"it's a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick .",positive
8467,"it's true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set .",positive
8468,"kevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana .",positive
8469,"after a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar .",positive
8470,"the small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other .",positive
8471,"when cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett .",positive
8472,"everyone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , "" and he's gay . """,positive
8473,the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop .,positive
8474,"the thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf .",positive
8475,"naturally the questions pour from howard's fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school's principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand .",positive
8476,"the frenzy isn't helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and "" entertainment tonight "" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning .",positive
8477,"one particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of "" inside entertainment "" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding .",positive
8478,"the intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute .",positive
8479,"it seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees .",positive
8480,the dominoes begin to tumble as howard's closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay .,positive
8481,"it all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren't presented with near-perfection by one of this year's most delightful ensemble casts .",positive
8482,"kline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here .",positive
8483,"the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully .",positive
8484,every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever .,positive
8485,"dillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they're up to bat .",positive
8486,"rudnick's script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you'll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes .",positive
8487,"while in & out doesn't carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around .",positive
8488,"the script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we're allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs .",positive
8489,"it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we're still allowed a sappily touching ending .",positive
8490,"despite it's subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy .",positive
8491,"frank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick's script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit .",positive
8492,check this one out .,positive
8493,you'll have a gay old time .,positive
8494,"with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different .",positive
8495,"its structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books .",positive
8496,"the parallels don't end there , either .",positive
8497,"atlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king's dreamcatcher .",positive
8498,even the film's content is a bit reminiscent of mile .,positive
8499,"in fact , it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile .",positive
8500,"king's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film's title comes from the second chapter ) .",positive
8501,"it's set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould's secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son .",positive
